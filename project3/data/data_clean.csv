throw_away4d3d,p8futg,0,1629499866,i am thinking of doing a road trip from denver to los angeles soon and i’m thinking about what would happen if my car breaks down in an area with no cell signal. i saw the weboost drive sleek on amazon for $ and was wondering if that would be a good buy for me. would that assure me at least coverage to be able to call aaa if my car breaks down? or is buying that not even necessary and i can save $? i think i would like the peace of mind but was wondering if anyone knows how well it would work on that trip in particular.
anchovi-suckeroni,p8nagi,0,1629531446,"hi, i'm wondering how you best meet people traveling solo. i have so far always avoided people on my travels, in fact in life in general. i am now  and i deeply regret having lived life as a loner. not only have i never had the opportunity to meet any women that way (whenever i was single) but even just people in general. on my next travels i'd like to change that. i'd like to go among people as much as possible and just have fun. now having avoided people mostly in my life i wonder, where do you meet fellow travelers and make friends? usually when i stayed at a hostel i only saw groups of people and never really saw any opportunity to get myself noticed without seeming like a weirdo who wants to interrupt a group of tight friends. not that i would have wanted to at the time anyway. so how do you meet people as a solo traveler? the only time i really ended up meeting people on solo travels was when on two different trips some two groups of girls randomly recognized me in a city after having seen me at the hostel before and suggested i join them. but that's just luck and not something i can rely on to happen again. i love traveling solo but i think i have missed out enjoying good times with other people so i'd like to take the initiative and actively seek out people to do things with. go sight seeing with, or relax at night with. i'm assuming that staying in hostels will be my best bet to make friends, but how exactly do you get yourself added to a group of people without being intrusive? or what about campgrounds or other places travelers frequent?"
strangely_unlucky,p8oeh1,0,1629537524,"hey! i'm a  years old guy looking to spend around  month in another country in october, either germany or austria (i'm currently learning german and i want to go to a german speaking country to help me with that). i plan on driving there so that i can have my car with me to move around the country if i want to, but essentially i would like to spend that month mostly in one city, to see what life there looks like. if restrictions are not too harsh, i would also like to go out at night sometimes, to visit stuff, to meet new people and so on. i'm % set on doing this, it's been on my mind for a few years now. the thing is, i've travelled outside my country only  times and it's been for  to  days trips, so this is going to be a totally new experience for me. any advice i can get? any suggestions regarding the city i should be choosing? i'm a total newbie and any information would be helpful regarding this trip. thanks! p.s: i am a software developer and i work remotely, so this month i would still be working half of the day, so i would prefer renting an airbnb instead of going to hostels. p.s : the ideal trip for me would be staying for one month in one city, then travelling around the country for around  week visiting stuff. i mostly look forward to experience a different lifestyle for that  month, not really the tourist type."

The-Smelliest-Cat,loh5w8,0,1613856472,"sometime next year i'm hoping to embark on a longer trip around the world, potentially for a year or so. but rather than be on the move all the time, i'd love to have a couple of places where i could just rent an apartment and stay in for a month or two. somewhere to rest, and spend more time getting to know the place. maybe go to a class or something along those lines! i've not looked into it much, but i know that not everywhere lets you stay so long, and renting an apartment isn't such an easy thing to do in a lot of places. so i was wondering if anyone has any good suggestions, or had done something like that somewhere themselves? ideally it would be: - not *horribly* expensive. prefferably under $ a month for a full private apartment. (cheaper is better!)
- a large city with plenty to see and do. - english friendly. (doesn't need to be english speaking, but somewhere where you can get by easily enough with english)
- if not a large city, then a very nice environment. like a very mountainous region, or a nice beach. - good public transport, and low crime.
- lots of day trips to go on. as i said i've not looked into it too much, but my current thoughts are (i live in the uk): - hong kong
- singapore - barcelona
- somewhere in the usa (miami/vegas/nyc/san francisco/chicago/honolulu)
- bangkok
- somewhere in australia or nz (sydney/melbourne/auckland)"

i have been solo travelling for many years now and ensure that i get one in every couple of years. in my last visit to portugal (before covid-) i had a different experience altogether. i got in touch with and was basically hosted by a local living in porto. even though i hate to be anchored during my solo travels and love the authenticity which comes with an unplanned trip. this guy totally blew me off with the local knowledge he had- about places to see, off the radar wineries, bespoke cafes and bars. hated it then but came out with a much fulfilling feeling of having visited the place like a local. do you guys try to get in touch with some locals before you visit a place? i’m actually thinking of creating a platform for solo travel enthusiasts to cross-host travelers. i feel this could provide a unique take on the place and could be a real value add for the traveler. what do you guys think? cheers!"

PtosisMammae,lqdyi9,0,1614070984,"sorry if this is slightly off topic in regards to solo-travel, but after years in this sub i know there are many people in here who might relate. some circumstances in regards to my studies means i will have time off from end of may all the way till end of august. i've been very burnt out for a while, and corona lockdown has made me appreciate nature and calm a lot more. so i was thinking i wanted to do some hiking from my parent's summerhouse for an extended period before the summer begins (by then it becomes crowded in the area). now my question is: how has it worked out for those of you who've taken time off of work for, let's say a month? i know it'll be different from job to job, but i just want to hear your input: was it easy? did your employers ask for a reason as to why? i looked in my calendar, and although the roster hasn't been made for the period, i can already see i have one meeting scheduled (which took  attempts to find a date). i'm also a bit concerned that i'll be away for the period in which the other students have exams, meaning i would be giving them an extra workload on top of exams."
ssg_partners,lqjpym,0,1614090738,"i love the mountains, especially villages on mountains. where in the schengen zone can i find beautiful mountains without burning a hole in my pocket? the first place that came to my mind was switzerland: geneva, zurich and villages in the switzerland. however, switzerland is too expensive for me. can you suggest me more affordable options?"

tommybartes,l24deb,0,1611253777,"i’ve solo traveled before to sea, australia, and brazil and had no problem meeting people. i’m planning to go to a lesser travelled to destination when covid is over like somewhere in africa. some destinations i’ve looked at don’t have hostels and i was wondering if people could provide an insight on how easy it is to meet people in these places, and if it isn’t easy any tips they have for doing so?
cheers"
mountainswithmegan,l25ik7,0,1611256836,"i don't have any international travel plans for this year, but this is something i've been wondering for awhile. in my mid and late-twenties, i always made friends at hostels while traveling. now that i'm , i feel like hostels aren't really my scene anymore. i just like a little more privacy and comfort nowadays. i don't really want to spend my travel time with a younger age group anymore. i like to go to bed early and not drink much alcohol while traveling. so my question is, where do travelers in their 's and older go to make friends while solo traveling?"

jeremyhendler,l29g2u,0,1611268054,okay i’m hoping somebody here can explain the whole sim card thing to me because i’m truly clueless on the topic. i tried to research online myself but i’m still lost. i live in the us and i’ll be visiting mexico for  days in may. i believe i can pay extra to verizon in advanced to avoid roaming charges. isn’t buying a sim card another option of mine to save money and get better service? i really don’t understand it. is it something i should be getting or not even worry about it? thanks!
CatSlooth,l2cmj1,0,1611278129,"some family members are having a hard time understanding why i want to solo travel, when i have a partner of over a decade who i have been traveling with the last few years. the truth is that i want a challenge, i want to know that i can do it on my own, i want to have my own journey of self discovery (as stupid and lame as that sounds). i've done so much traveling with my bf and will continue to do that when i get back from my solo trip which is a month long, but i want to try something different and have my own adventure and he will have his own adventure while i'm gone. we are not a traditional couple and we highly value freedom and goddamnit we've been together for almost half of our lives - to say we are secure in our relationship is the understatement of the century. but some people are convinced that this means that we are about to break up and that i'm being reckless (even though i've always been the one to plan our trips and i've done soooo much research and we literally will not break up). i'm doing it anyway, but i can't deny that their bad impressions and lack of faith is hurtful to me and makes me feel ashamed of my decision, like i'm a bad person. has anyone ever had an experience like this? how do you deal with the judgement??"

Charmycole,l2qhux,0,1611330912,"i just realized that traveling has kept me going for years. it literally saved my life. i miss traveling so much and i’m tempted to book a flight for mexico since they are allowing us in, but i know that’s really selfish and just wrong. so i’m not going to. i’m going to wait it out until it’s safe for me and everyone else. i know i need to find other ways to be happy. i miss connecting with others and exploring cultures. i keep telling myself life will get better, that i will wake up one morning and everything will be okay. i’ll be happy. but i don’t think it’s ever going to happen until i get to my next destination—i’m sadder today than i was last night. i’m drowning and there’s no rescue on the way. i’m going to hold my breath for as long as i can. i just don’t know for how long. i want an escape."

Fruitcake36,l2v293,0,1611343803,"from the uk. yearning to go sa/ca for a solid year.  years old, left my career in sales/finance now sort of at a dead-end for the moment, just working in a call centre. currently learning computer coding on the side, but it's very early days still. i'm torn between getting a normal remote customer service gig for a saas company, supporting myself with casual online esl teaching, or just travelling with no work commitment and doing things like volunteering at hostels for free etc. i have about £k saved up, but don't want to hamper my funds too much. equally though, i don't want a big gap on my cv. but i do want to enjoy travelling too :-d. and i just wonder if i will do that whilst sitting inside my airbnb, working a - gig. the other issue too is we don't know how long we might have to wait to travel. here in the uk, the noise is that we could be in lockdown for a very long time still. if that's the case i might best off getting a remote gig that would pay better than call centre work and saving up, but then equally, chopping and changing employers on the cv starts to look bad after a while. anyone else conflicted about working on the go vs pure travelling?"
writer005,l2wrsp,0,1611348779,"does anyone have any educated guesses about when international borders will reopen in popular destinations within europe and asia? i’ve researched it online, read articles published in the travel industry, and read posts/comments in travel groups like this one. once the elderly and vulnerable are vaccinated, i hope we’ll see a dramatic drop in covid deaths and hospitalizations, which i hope will lead to many international borders being reopened. i was thinking that many countries in europe and asia will reopen their borders to vaccinated travelers during the summer of this year, . but i’ve seen comments online that indicate that many travelers believe it’ll be  before travel is allowed. i understand that travel might not feel “normal” for a while, but when do you think travel will simply be allowed?"
mattventurer,l2zmco,0,1611357171,"is it just me or does anyone else feel the sadness of knowing that the people you meet during your travels, the people you share the same stories and time, the people you developed a connection with, will only be just part of your memories and nothing more? every time i think about it, it makes me sad thinking that the chances of me meeting these people again will be close to zero. maybe i will meet them again, but who knows when. as someone with limited budget and time, it’s almost impossible. how do you move on or handle the melancholia? how do you accept that these people you befriends with will soon become strangers again? i guess for me, this is one of the annoying thing about solotravel, it gives you a fleeting experience of “friendship”. has anyone else felt the same thing?"

theSoloLazyTraveller,l46rda,0,1611519693,"hi all solo travellers!! this is a follow-up question on my school project. i posted onto this group a month ago asking about the biggest challenges/why people travel alone. **to recap, here were the top challenges:** . safety
. feeling alone at times. . nobody able to take their photos (too many selfies)
. watching their belongings **why solo travel:** . freedom (do and go whatever and where i want)
. can't match schedule with friends (don't wait to wait) **problem**: as a solo traveller, i need to be concerned about my safety and belongings, this restricts me from doing all the activities i want to do. **hypothesis:** i believe that by providing a service that will ensure safety and aid to all solo travellers, it will help them achieve a memorable trip **possible solution:** i was thinking that in order to solve these challenges, there can be a service/platform to help solo travellers. the idea behind this service is to pair a local ""tour"" guide to a solo traveller. that way the local guide can bring you around, feel safe, help take photos, etc. i would love to hear everyone's feedback on the idea, and whether or not this will ""help"" them on their travels. please see the poll, on possible features on the platform. thanks in advance!! #xb; [view poll]()"

bigjunga69,l4hqxu,0,1611555834,"quick back story i graduated high school and traveled the u.s by myself sleeping in my car and staying in hostels for about two months. while on this trip i was the happiest and most free i’ve felt in my entire life. now that i’ve been back for  months i’m not sure which path to take. should i save up some more money for a couple months again and travel but be unsure about my future. i want to travel full time and have the thrill and adventure i had on that trip that i once took, but unfortunately this isn’t sustainable i want to be able to connect with people through social media and help them. sadly the likelihood of me actually becoming successful and be able to fund my travels is very slim. i’m also contemplating going to college and becoming a travel surgical tech and using that to fund my adventures. although i find health care somewhat fascinating i just couldn’t see myself being in that field. i would only use that job for the funds and stability of income to be able to travel. i know life is very precious and yes i’m young but my life could be over any second so i want to do what i love. also i want something that i know i can make money doing so i can travel as long as i want. i just don’t want to waste  years of my life stuck in the same place before i can even start my dream. i’m really torn up about this and have been contemplating both options for a couple months now. any insight would be appreciated. thank you :)"
5harmoota,l4iexq,0,1611558551,"my car is dying and i need to buy a vehicle to last me until it's safe to travel internationally again. vanlife has been on my mind for the past few months for being a relatively ""safe"" method of travel during covid, and i've test driven a few vans but i am too scared to pull the trigger. my main hesitations are: . i've never slept in a vehicle before and it kind of scares me.
. i don't love driving a large vehicle.
. i'm afraid i'll have a hard time selling it afterwards because i don't plan on doing it long term, only (hopefully) a few months until it's safe to travel internationally again. that being said, i feel like roadtripping in a car may be more expensive and less covid safe? if i'm in a city i can't exactly cook meals or poop in a bucket in my car lol so i'd have to go in and out of places. i also work remotely so sitting inside a car to work on the road would be very uncomfortable. i've been going back and forth between the two in my head for ages and definitely could use some perspective to help make a decision."

(we were told it would be a shuttle but hey, central america) out came peter who said he was our shuttle... we reluctantly got into the van. he assured us that everything was going to be fine as he hit the gas peddle. literally did not give a bother about the speed bumps, he was sending it. (in the front was his baby mama, smacking some gum, checking her nails and ignoring every attempt to communicate with us.) i decided that this car ride would be the perfect time to take an edible i got on utila. i could just snooze, wake up at the border, and then finish out the ride to el salvador. so i dozed off very quickly. at am i was abruptly woken up by peter who was asking for our passports. as i came out of my high, sleepy daze i realized we had been brought to a mall parking lot. the lot was mainly empty except for two torched/battered vehicles and peter was getting aggressive at this point so i asked him where we were and why he needed our passports. he said we were in tegucigalpa he was putting us on a bus and that we shouldn’t worry. we were pissed. but he was not going to take us any further and the bus kiosk was in the mall. i was not about to give this man of false promises our passports, so i walked in the mall with him. i had picked up enough spanish to realize he had just made a profit since our new private shuttle was only $ a piece. whatever. we waited at the terminal got on our bus. the next part should have been smooth but it only got worse. (i realized i had left my snickers bar, earphones, and water bottle in peter’s minivan.) at the border of es risa i got our passport stamps but anna hadn’t gotten on the bus. the attendant came by said the bus needed to leave and we needed to get her. so i entered immigration only to see her outline behind a tinted door and two guards inside. apparently, anna was not allowed to enter into es because she had two entrance stamps from guatemala. (wtf?) they both had entrance circled. and one needed to have an exit circles. (but again we were entering the country from honduras.) they said that she was not allowed until she got this fixed. as we left immigration risa was on the road with our bags the bus left. by this point in time i am not as high, but it is noon and the sun is beating down on us as were in this weird limbo of not being in either country... enter juan his taxi. he asks us where we need to go. anna snarkily responds guatemala he informs us that there is a border just  minutes away. we negotiate a price, re enter honduras, and start the journey to aguas caliantes. on the way, final destination style, a dump truck in front of us starts to lift all the boulders in its container at us. juan was not the most attentive driver by the time we were reversing rocks were hitting the road. we get the border of guatemala and the woman behind the counter laughs at our situation, and with a ballpoint pen crosses out the entrance section, circles the exit, and signs her name. she said that it’s fixed and now anna should be able to enter. well, anna was not able to enter. after reexiting honduras and attempting to enter es, the same immigration officers said that they did not believe we had gone to the border of guatemala that we forged this change in her passport. it was a very frustrating time. they said that risa i could enter, but anna could not. then, it dawned on us, juan! risa ran out and got him and he vouched for anna. the immigration officers were clearing upset, and upon granting anna permission into the country they looked at her as she was leaving and said, “just know we have rules here in this country.” getting from the border to the coast took another  taxis, a sketchy gas station in san salvador, our cards getting declined, and all in all  hours before we were in beds at a hostel. it was the worst logistical nightmare to be in with limited spanish. however, we lived to tell the tale. it’s interesting how these moments with these people can be looked back on with laughter fondness."

• ""spider-man"" (m) - a few weeks ago this guy got arrested for climbing the big ben dressed as spider man (search it up on google i dare you). he told me it was his st birthday stunt and he was protesting just about everything that’s gone wrong this year, covid-, black lives matter, lgbtq movements etc in a good old ""fuck the government way"". he walks around the hostel everyday in his spider-man suit, but unfortunately is leaving tomorrow, along with his eight suitcases in two supermarket trolleys, on his way to birmingham to apparently sue every member of parliament. leaves me with a message of ""dont you worry, spider-man has much greater things planned soon"". • ""the pink guy"" (sm) - scottish guy who always dressed in pink, ended up getting kicked out for the following reasons... screaming at a coca-cola can while laying on the floor, running away from police naked, wanking in his room and pooping in the street. • ""the tall dutch girl"" (f), apparently came to london to be with the love of her life however he is never to be seen. she looses every bodies trust on day one after she goes through all of our bags in the dorm when we have all been sleeping together for weeks. now she lives in the bathroom, assumably she sneaks into the hostel each day and sleeps there because she can’t afford to pay each night. • ""the man on the phone"" (sm) - who always seems to be talking on the phone however claims he’s talking to the ghosts of the building, i kid you not , full on arguments and everything. he left yesterday i believe as his neighbour was threatening to call the police as she was concerned for his mental well-being. • now let’s introduce his neighbour ""the crazy lady"" (sf), volunteers daily with nhs and comes off as a lovely person until, after staff explaining the kitchen is for restaurant use only she throws her sausage rolls at the bin which then falls over, shit everywhere. sprinkles salt along the floor outside of her door in the hallway to keep the ""bad demons away"", goes round the hostel asking people if the had had any inexplainable experiences with ghosts in the building. • ""the eastern european girl"" (f), the first time you see her, she’ll always be asking for a cigarette. but this girl got known for when she was hooking up with the ""pink guy"" in the smoking area, i think gossip flew round a lot because she was also a cleaner at the hostel. she must have quit her job at some point in the last week because now she sits across the road from the hostel on thé street with all her luggage and still, asks for cigarettes. i tell you, hostel life is the interesting side of life"

JimboAscendant,kj95wi,0,1608785955,"i'm learning spanish at the moment, and i think by the time travel becomes possible again, i will have a basic handle on how to get by with everyday things. i'm a single recently divorced guy, , gringo. i live in los angeles, ca and i'm trying to figure out what the best plan would be. i have a totally remote job and a very low-cost living situation right now. i have done some international travel in europe in the past. cost is probably not an issue. the idea i'm kicking around is * book - week trip
* go to place and work from there one-two weeks, enjoy food and nightlife in the mean time
* go on adventures in that place for the rest of the time. and the countries i'm kicking around are * argentina (ba, patagonia)
* chile
* costa rica
* mexico (cdmx, yucatan)
* colombia
* peru things i like: * trying food i could never find anywhere else
* mind-bogglingly beautiful vistas and hiking
* getting a feel for a city
* coffee
* beaches, volcanoes
* friendly locals if you were in my position, what would you do?"

Ukrainepolandborder,kjv9mt,0,1608881746,"i plan on doing a backpacking trip across turkey and potentially parts of the soviet union this may. my itinerary is . fly from us to turkey via paris on air france. free  kg check in baggage
. travel around turkey using turkish airlines, trains, busses, or skyexpress airlines. all airlines allow free check in baggage . (if all countries lift covid rules by then): public transport or train from turkey to georgia. then georgia onto yerevan, armenia. i will skip this section if countries still have covid rules.
. fly from either turkey or armenia to kyiv, ukraine. airline will be either ukraine international or skyup. kg checked baggage will cost $-$
. if the eu allows us travelers by then. fly from kyiv to warsaw poland on skyup. checking in will cost $ (which is % of the cost of the flight). then fly from warsaw to chicago on tap portugal. this will cost me an extra $ vs purchasing the tap discount fare. so basically, i will be paying an extra $ ish to bring in a checked in suitcase on board all my flights. i'm just not sure if i can bring - weeks worth of stuff in a backpack. also, currently all i have are ""school backpacks"". any particular bags you recommend?"

glory1812,jzkzsm,0,1606149470,"just thought i could share with youse this information. one the things you need to know while planning your safari to tanzania, africa is ""time to travel"" here is the months breakdown which i thought could be helpful for someone to decide when to travel. tanzania seasons: january to february: it is normally dry and hot. it is the calving season for the wilderbeests so the wilderbeests will be at southern part of serengeti, ndutu area. though february is the only time of the year which is guranteed to see the big herds all together move to south of serengeti for calving. easier to spot wildlife. good time for birds watching since migratory birds are present. march, april may, this is peak of wet season. grasses becomes green and beautiful. rains may interfere your trip, parks are less crowded, low rates applies. animals including the wilderbeests which are famous for migration are more dispersed. june: it is a transitional period from rain season to dry season. grassess become green. the wilderbeests start moving from central to north serengeti. migration can be seen in the western corridor of serengeti until july. july to october: it is dry season in tanzania, mostly sunny. morning and nights get cold. from august to sept the great heards of wilderbeests and zebras move from northern serengeti to maasai mara by crossing mara river, easy to spot animals because grasses will be grazed by hebivores and also most of animals concentrates around waterholes. it is quite crowded around seronera area in serengeti. high season rates applies. november to december: it is short rain season though it is still not bad to come. the grasses becomes green and beautiful. all in all, there is no bad time to visit tanzania, africa beacause each month has it's own uniqueness."

HitchhikingToNirvana,k0q14a,0,1606301341,"public transportation in egypt seems to be quite complicated. i have read that certain trains (or compartments) are accessible only for egyptian nationals and that as a foreigner, you have to book a more expensive luxury compartment (for example for going from cairo to luxor). the same for ferries. i looked into the one from hurghada to sharm, and the price is way more expensive for tourists. is there any way to avoid these restrictions and get normal train (and maybe ferry) tickets in egypt? is just buying the ticket once you are already on the train a viable option? i wan to see the following places: - cairo
- luxor
- aswan
- dahab

(i was standing in front of a traffic light, so they had to stop). i was ignored and batted away. finally, a kind trans person came out of a local business and called me a private taxi. that's the service i used the rest of my time in milan, i never could get a cab just by hailing there. and i didn't have phone service so i couldn't use uber or lyft. i've never been so aware of my color in all my life. i'm a  in fenty, cocoa girl and i had long faux locs for traveling convenience. i was staying in a residential area of milan and people would literally stare at me when i walked down the street. a lot of it was racism but some of it was xenophobia against the african immigrants there. when i wore any kind of american paraphernalia i was treated wayyyyyyy better. i moved onto rome quickly. it was better but still awful. i'll just never know what percentage was racial. one night, i went to a ballet at la scala and bumped into some white american tourists. and they told me about how badly they were treated as tourists! some of what they said sounded very familiar. that leg of trip wasn't all bad. i did some great shopping, had the best gelato ever, saw the vatican, enjoyed the eternal city. but i don't know if i'll ever go back, not even for venice or naples. i felt so isolated and unsafe. has anyone experienced this? anything suggestions?"

Spacebuscuit,jh51xp,0,1603525674,it'd be great if you are someone who's already been down this road. would love pointers from you. i'm guessing border hopping would be the most economical choice. but i also understand that flying sometimes would be cheaper if the border is too remote on both ends. also there is the visa issue where some countries either allow no entry visa land or offer a less advantageous visa when coming in through the border. so your experience here would be greatly appreciated.
ivyraveneve,jh61zo,0,1603531525,"i saw some negative experiences from people visiting india. as an indian now living in the us, here are my two cents that i believe will make a trip to india much much better. . i do not recommend visiting the big metropolitan cities (delhi, mumbai) unless you are a foodie. they are unsafe and chaotic and hard to navigate. if you have an indian friend then spend a couple days in one city with them and eat lots of food. if you like clubbing then hit up some clubs, because the indian clubbing experience is unique and lots of fun. but make sure to go with a native friend who has experience. i am from delhi. . visit the mountains in the north. go trekking. if any of you want recommendations on hiking companies then feel free to dm me. . visit the south, i highly recommend the backwaters in kerala. . visit rajasthan, a state with incredibly unique culture with everything from architecture, food, music and clothing. but do not visit the big cities like jaipur. they aren’t worth it. . hit up some national parks. i recommend kaziranga, gir national park etc. . the northeast is beautiful and you will never find culture like you find in certain places there, like shillong and nagaland. . continue on to nepal or bhutan."

sonicruiser,jiccxe,0,1603709352,"in april of next year, i have to drive to tucson for some work/business purposes. so assuming a baseline, i will have to drive to arizona and back at the bare minimum for this trip. i have wanted to do a long solo road trip across the us landscapes for some time. i have enough vacation days to take approximately - days off on top of - days for my work in tucson. so assuming that, i will have about  weeks to do this trip give or take a few days. my estimates say that just the driving part of this trip will take - hrs. so i will budget a week for just driving. that leaves me with the other week for my work in tucson and any stops i make, so it will probably be a split of - days in tucson and - days of sightseeing in various cities/parks across the us for a combined total of  days of non-driving. this trip from end to end will be roughly , miles. i will be driving to arizona no matter what due to work, but i would like to see more of the western us by road as it is meant to be seen. the longest drive i have done before is tampa-el paso-tampa so this will be quite a bit longer than that. i am fully aware that this trip will be very tolling on the body, but it should also be the adventure of a lifetime. any advice on travel tips or what to see along the way is greatly appreciated. with that in mind, here is the planned route: tampa-dallas dallas-tucson tucson-phoenix phoenix-grand canyon grand canyon-los angeles los angeles-san francisco san francisco-sacramento sacramento-lake tahoe lake tahoe-portland portland-seattle seattle-salt lake city salt lake city-denver denver-kansas city kansas city-st louis st louis-indianpolis indianpolis-detroit detroit-cincinnati cincinnati-atlanta atlanta-tampa "

* mexico city:  days, including a day trip to teotihuacán
* puebla:  days
* oaxaca:  days, during the festivities i'm planning on travelling domestically by bus, are there any other stops along my route you would suggest? are two days in puebla too little time? also, if you have recommendations on where to stay in those places i'd be glad to hear them! as for dia de muertos in oaxaca, i found a trip on g-adventures which covers that part of my trip and would also add a few days in puerto escondido. since it's very reasonably priced and i've also read some positive reviews on g-adventores on here i'm thinking about booking that. if anyone here travelled with them in mexico i'd be happy about some reviews. finally a somewhat cultural question. where i'm from all saints day is a rather private holiday. you visit the graves of family and friends, which have been decorated the days before, but it would be rather strange to have tourists there. from what i've read online that's quite different for dia de muertos - as long as you behave and dress accordingly it's fine to visit the graveyards. any locals or people that have been in mexico for dia de muertos here that wanna chime in? i just want to make sure i don't offend anyone while im there."

OfeliasUnderworld,jk9axs,0,1603975378,i don’t mind traveling off the path there by any means to check out new areas as i was originally going to new orleans in between (just rethinking that plan now that zeta came through). i’m interested in natural or unique sights that’d still be accessible today tomorrow (not affected by flooding or closed due to covid). i only plan on staying somewhere one night (possibly two different spots one night each) before hitting brownsville so i wanted to see what’d be worth visiting on my own. bonus points if there are any decent hammock spots in between (: thoughts?

CenturyOldMilk,iygln5,0,1600887746,"i had booked about two months in advance for a trip i had planned to monterrey/big sur for mid september. as the date approached for the trip wildfires started to break out around the area around mid august. these fires were bad and were making air quality horrible and were getting close to the hotel we were staying at. it was counterintuitive to stay somewhere so close to the fires only to just stay indoors the whole time, or worst get stuck out there - hours away from home. although our stay was still a few weeks away, i made the decision to try to cancel the booking because there was no sign the fires would let up, they did not let up even on the date of our booking. i couldn't have known that and the hotel/ couldn't have known that either, but judging on how bad the fires were and still are, they refused to refund my money. the property we were staying at told us specifically that we had to deal with in order to get our refund. upon contacting them they then told us that we had to deal with the property directly in order to get our refund. this back and forth lasted for a good hour. that's not an exaggeration. an hour of back and forth trying to reason with the property made it clear that on their end, they had not received any payment and that since i booked with a third party (), they were the ones responsible in issuing me a refund. even if the property wanted to they couldn't refund me money they hadn't received. making this very clear to the handful of representatives at that ""assisted"" me, they insisted that the property was the one responsible in issuing me my refund. you can see how infuriating it is when all they did was throw their hands up and tried to shoe me away when clearly stating to them there was no money to return on the property's behalf. they stated that because the property did not clear the transaction they had nothing to give back to me. so my question is now, current day, where did my money go? of course to i am now out the money i paid for a reservation we never attended and despite filing a claim they still won the case and kept my money. stay far away from i'm not sure how it is getting refunded with other third party booking agencies, but definitely do not book with whatever money you think you're saving it's not worth it. just book directly with the property and save yourself the frustration and financial stress of giving your money to a company whose interest is not with the customer but with their own pockets."

at madison junction in the gibbon river, there was a crowd watching something, and i caught a glimpse of a moose heading into the woods. i stopped, and for the next two hours i followed the bull moose and two cows (from a safe distance of course). they stayed in the woods for a while, but i knew they would head back to the river, and eventually they did. they put on a great show! be sure to watch the video in my album, it was a trip highlight! day  - monday. plan: hike, tour, geyser watch in ynp left madison at am. drove to old faithful area, and watched of at am with just a handful of people. from there, hiked to mallard lake, . miles rt (nice hike with no other people). walked the upper geyser basin – saw grand geyser, daisy, lion (twice), of from beehive. then i took a break in the car because riverside was predicted in about . hours. as i sat in my car, i watched herds of people and cars, and got frustrated – all of that commotion wasn’t what i wanted. did some research and found a backup – hiked up purple mountain, . miles rt (challenging climb, great view, few people). drove firehole canyon drive, and took a dip in the river. drove to grand prismatic in the evening, but there were so many people still there so i didn’t stop. day  - tuesday. plan: drive to gtnp, get campsite, hike to delta lake left madison at am, and drove toward gtnp via canyon and hayden valley. saw  elk including two bulls, all of them were solo. in gtnp, stopped at mormon row and the ta moulton barn. drove to gros ventre to get a campsite. i waited in line for about  minutes, and finally got a site for  nights at about am. headed out for the hike of the day – lupine meadows th to delta lake. . miles rt,  feet elevation gain. fun, challenging hike, with an amazing view at the end, but delta lake is no “secret” hike. then relaxed at the campsite in the evening. day  - wednesday. plan: hike cascade canyon to lake solitude depart gros ventre at am headed to string lake th. hiked string lake, through cascade canyon, to lake solitude, and back. . miles total with  feet of elevation gain. this was an amazing hike!

Geo85,iztm1f,0,1601073065,"how do you quantify/qualify 'authentic' ? it's a catchphrase. *cuba authentica!* what makes your travels more authentic than anyone else's? i think most people would agree las vegas or niagara falls (the city in niagara falls) isn't authentic. i think most people would agree going to that country for enough time to learn the language make some local friends would be as authentic as it gets. for me - i like to live with locals where i go (which is why i like airbnb, or trying to convince a friend of a friend to host me), avoid those places that host tons of tourists (think those party hostels). i think as long as you've done something that wouldn't be accesssible to you back home - you've done something a little bit authentic. what think you?"

Malau14,j0371x,0,1601113060,"since we can’t currently return to the office, my company has made a policy that we can work from any country as long as we have a working permit. being from the eu, i have therefore decided to settle in portugal. i’m currently in porto, but would like to travel further down south to a place where it’s possible to easily surf after work/in the weekends. i’ve done a lot of research into where in portugal there’s ) nice waves for beginners. ) an interesting city to explore. ) fast enough wifi to work from permanently. so far, i’ve come up with faro and lisbon, but i would love to hear if anyone in here has experience with portugal and can help me out."
rakuu,j0cx96,0,1601151096,"i really don't like being in crowds, and i'm guessing most of you don't either. the easiest way to avoid crowds is just to wake up early. you can have a very leisurely morning breakfast, go for a nice long walk alone in a very picturesque neighborhood or park, go see some busy sights if you want to, and then have an early lunch when restaurants aren't busy and the food is freshest. i'm also self-conscious when eating alone in most busy restaurants, but i don't care at all when there's hardly anyone else eating. i just saw a post in r/travel where someone said it's impossible to avoid pictures with ridiculous crowds at the great wall of china. well, i just woke up early, and walked nearly the entire public section of mutianyu very leisurely before anyone else showed up except a couple vendors setting up for the day. then i often take a break in the early afternoon when everyone else is crowding transit and cafes and restaurants and shops and sights and cool neighborhoods -- eg, laying in a park, the beach, back in my room doing some planning, hostel common area, etc. then in late afternoon/early evening i like to visit places that opened later and have usually slowed down -- shops, teahouses, cafes, markets, art galleries, etc. then again, have an early dinner while food is freshest, service is fast, and there's hardly anyone else there. what about nightlife and drinking? well, i haven't really drunk much since my first year or so of traveling. of course drinking is a highlight for a lot of travelers, but honestly i'd rather drink at home. if there's a type of drink or nightlife experience i'd like -- again, i'll go early at night when again there are fewer people and faster service. i've also found that it's a lot easier to meet and have conversations earlier on, especially local folk. obviously i don't go hard partying much, but once in a while i'll stay out late and wake up later. i'm not a ""morning person"" at all at home. i woke up at :am this morning for example. but, i find it a lot easier traveling since i'm usually exhausted and a little jet lagged the first day anyway, and it's easier to reset my schedule to go to bed wake up early. i've never been able to convince travel partners to do this with me, and i'm more likely to stay out late with other travel partners, but going solo it's easy. anyone else have experience with successes waking up early while traveling?"

takkamilblog,j0gs4y,0,1601164814,"living under $ a month in poland so it all basically started when i had to move back to my grandparents place. i was low on money, low on self-esteem, and life had fatigued me to the point that i needed a break from everything and everyone. it didn't really go as i expected though, living with my grandparents was an emotional roller coaster, but i survived and eventually rented a room in a bigger city nearby. the rent cost me around $, that's including the deposit. but as soon as i made the transition i knew that money was low and i had to be very careful with where and how i spent my money. with around  usd in my account left i knew that i had to be very frugal with my spendings otherwise i wouldn't be able to pay next month's rent, but living in difficult situations in the past gave me some courage though. so the first step was to figure out what i needed money for, i kind of had to design my life based of my current financial situation. ""first thing, i want to eat healthy, so i'll probably stick with a vegetarian diet, i also want to go out to cafes once or twice a week for a coffee, and maybe travel on the weekends. i got to pay  usd for rent every month, and i make around  usd every month so that means i got $ to spend for the whole month - meaning $ for each week. now... how the fuck can i do that?"" i knew that living this way was going to be tough. first thing was that i needed to cook in bulk that way i would be able to feed myself for the entire week and this way i could save money by not eating out. there were already pots and pans in the house so that save me a bit of money. and i might have to push back the weekened trips for now until i find more work. so ""week one"" began. i bought in bulk, only buying essentials. i figured out that i could probably cook a curry dish for cheap. just needed a bunch of vegetables, curry powder, few other spices, tomato sauce as the base, and maybe throw in some beans or chikapeas to get those proteins. i also bought a few cans of tuna bc they had olive oil in them, and eggs so that i could get my meat nutrients covered. so did all of that, had the groceries all in my basket. i was expecting to buy food for at least  days, but i'm sure i had more, or it just felt like it. some guy in the line commented ""ohh you're buying food for the whole week, huh?"" ""yeah gotta eat man"" lady started scanning the items, i was hoping to pay under  usd. ""what is your biedronka card number?"" ""blah blah blah blah blah blah"" ""it will be  zl"" 'oh shit. that's pretty good' i thought to myself. that's like  usd dollars. ""alright i will pay with card"" peep i loaded all the items into my backpack and an extra bag i bought, jesus it was heavy, and went off home. ""see you later"" i had about  usd left, which could be used for coffee or tea. coffee where i live cost usually around  -  usd, so twice a week i could go for coffee. came home, cut up the vegetables, threw them in the big orange pot (like those ones that your grandma has), popped the tuna and drained the olive oil in the pot, i let it cook for  minutes, then i threw in the tomato sauce, the beans and the spices. i let it simmer for a good  to  minutes and it was all ready. i also forgot to mention that i bought rice, which only cost about  dollar for a pound. washed it, put it on the stove and also let it simmer for a good  minutes. i realised that i had a whole pot of food. it was huge. enough for at least  days, but it lasted me  days. i had a small breakfast, and two medium sized meals for m, t, w, th, f, and sa, which was perfect for me. on sundays i would just eat something light, maybe some fruits or whatever was left over. i followed this routine for a few weeks, buying just the essentials. after the third week i started to make a bit more money because i was working as a freelance designer, so sometimes i get a project that pays a bit. so now my groceries cost me just under $ (per week) because i buy maybe some extra tuna or some snacks. let's not forget that i wanted to travel during the weekends so that i wasn't too bored where i lived. the city that i stay in is a fairly populated city, with just under , people, but lots of these people are kids and old ladies. it's a very family oriented city, you can walk one block and you will probably see a mother with her stroller. now that i'm making a bit more money online, i still don't splurge. when i travel i pay around  usd for a round way ticket to a bigger city nearby called krakow, and adding accomodation for a night or two costs me around  - usd, and when i travel i try not to eat out, maybe i grab a coffee here or there, but i try to be frugal. so in total, nowadays i'm spending under $ for a whole months of eating really good homemade meals, breakfast, lunch and dinner, having a coffee once or twice a week, and getting to travel on the weekends to the bigger city for free events or meetups that interest me. and during some weekends my friends travel to krakow so i just crash on their couch to save a bit on accommodation. this seems pretty low-budget to me for the type of lifestyle i'm living. and people might ask ""why are you doing that?"" well my perspective in this moment is i don't want to be stuck in the rat race, i'm at a point where i had enough and it's time for me to get out and actually build a company of my own. i see it in a way that we're given these two resources of, energy and time. and if you're working a regular job yes you'll make money, but you'll be spending a lot of your time doing something repetitive and 'most likely' something you don't like doing, and so you're trading your energy and time, just so that you can make a bit and get by. and that 'bit', the money, can be used as a leverage to pull yourself out of the rat race, or it can be something that just digs you deeper into the rat race. so i try to use the money that i make (and even though it's not so much at the moment) as a resource to invest into my feature, rather than spending it on temporary pleasures like alcohol or such things. but i'm not saying ""don't spend at all"", you should definitely reward yourself for hard work, i do. so that's all i got for now. hope this was useful to you. if you got any questions please let me know, leave a comment below this post, or send me a message via the contact form on my blog takkamil"
Jacquelinekatie,j0hxoj,0,1601169229,hey y’all! has anyone here been to/are you from new hampshire? i have been wanting to check it out for a while now and wanted to see if anyone here had any tips or suggestions of what to see/visit within the state. thanks in advance!
swingingpendulums,j0j55c,0,1601173995,"i have just finished  days travelling around the beautiful country of costa rica. here is my trip report on what i did, and some tips for anyone planning something similar in the future. **part  - playa guiones** the first section of my trip was spent in the nicoya peninsula in nw costa rica. i stayed in the pretty sweet little town of playa guiones. it had some decent restaurants and is great if you like surfing. there aren't any hostels here to speak of, so airbnb it was. the main reason i was here was to see the [turtles in ostional](). it was a pretty awesome experience. the olive ridley turtles come on the beach (en-mass) to nest a few times every year. to see the number of turtles on this one beach at am was a pretty special experience. interestingly, the turtles are pretty solitary creatures out at sea and only come onto the beach to lay their eggs, before returning to life alone. **note on turtles:** best to visit early in the morning to have the best chance of seeing them. the cost to get in was approx. $ which goes towards the conservation of these turtles. it is one of only  places in the world that this event happens so if you're in the area (and it is happening), i really recommend it. **part  - santa teresa** next, i visited the small town of santa teresa on the southern coast of the peninsula. unfortunately, there are no buses from the north-south of the peninsula. the only option from playa guiones is pg - nicoya - puntarenas - ferry to paquera - bus to cobano - bus to santa teresa. should take you about  hours to do what could be a -hour drive. in st, i stayed in the super nice [luz de luna](). the place is run by a really cool belgian guy and has these amazing little huts overlooking a great jungle garden. seeing monkeys in the evening was pretty sweet! here i didn't do a huge amount except explore the local area. there are atvs that you can rent in the main town and there are loads of tide pools along the coast which are pretty cool to swim in. again, this is a good place if you enjoy surfing! (or yoga). **part  - puerto viejo de talamanca** i then did a very long trip from santa teresa to puerto viejo de limon (on the caribbean coast). i spent a night in san josé just to break up the journey. this was by far my favourite part of the whole couple of weeks. i really liked the caribbean food (way spicier than what i was getting on the pacific coast) and there was a lot more going on. i stayed in the pretty awesome [rocking j's hostel](). thanks to many recommendations on here for that! the hammocks were super cheap ($ p/n) and the staff were super chill. the location is great -  second walk to the beach! here, i mainly ate loads of awesome caribbean chicken and fish + went to the amazing [gandoca manzanillo wildlife refuge]() where i saw loads of toucans, macaws, sloths + loads more monkeys. to get there, i hired a bicycle from rocking j's and cycled the  or so km. apart from that, i also did quite a bit of snorkelling in the sea off rocking j's and met some pretty cool people! if anyone has any questions, let me know! they're normally my favourite thing to read on reddit travel subs so hope some of you enjoyed this one. i haven't yet worked out how much it all cost but, probably, quite a lot. costa rica is frustratingly expensive."
ulterior-motives,j0kerw,0,1601179344,"i'm wondering if now is a good time to go somewhere. is it cheaper now? or more expensive? i don't think we'll ever get fewer crowds than right now, so i'm tempted to go how has covid affected: * flight ticket prices
* hotel/hostel prices
* tours/museum prices
* in city travel prices
* food i'm not really interested in anything crowded like concerts or night light or bars or stuff, i'm more of a museum/monument nut. of course, keeping in mind all the precautions, masks, hand sanitizers, in general staying away from humans etc. still, permanent lung damage would have to go under 'cons'."
antisarcastics,j0m60l,0,1601187490,"i have long struggled to decide whether i feel more introvert or extravert and usually tell people i'm an extraverted introvert... or an introverted extravert. but recently i feel more and more that i probably am an introvert at heart, and one of my main pieces of evidence for this is my desire to travel solo for extended periods of time. so this got me to wondering if you all, my fellow lone travellers, also identify as such, or if there are some of you amongst us who indeed consider themselves extraverted, and if so, do you ever struggle to travel alone or do you genuinely enjoy it?"

* i get to keep my same number without having to port it over to google voice
* nearly worldwide coverage
* no need to get a new sim card every time i switch to another country
* unlimited data cons:
* it's not very popular yet and i can't seem to find reviews from travelers
* price, while decent, is a bit high. i'll be traveling mostly in latin america, so i'm sure i can find cheaper plans. option . use my unlocked phone and stick a sim card in with a new plan every time i go to another country. i'd import my number to google voice so as long as i have data, i'll be able to talk and text with people back home without a hassle. pros:
* potentially cheaper
* more options for service providers cons:
* it will be a hassle to switch sim cards every time i enter a new country
* i'm not sure if unlimited data plans really exist in latin america. i'm honestly leaning towards option one due to sheer convenience, but want to know if anyone here has experience with the service. also, the cost of an unlimited data plan with local carriers would be a factor into my decision. anyone have any sort of data for an unlimited plan in, say, mexico? maybe on claro o movistar? thank you all so much!"

FreeFlowFlo,ighfqd,0,1598378516,"hello, since a few weeks i’ve been exploring on reddit and a few of its subreddits, especially the reddits about vanlife, traveling and the outdoors. i’m not really the big talker so the fact that i feel like sharing a bit of my story is quite interesting to me. the core of this post will be about the insights i’ve had while traveling and what the vanlife has brought me so far. i feel like there is a lot of doubt when it comes to committing to the vanlife for a longer period of time. maybe this can be a bit of a help for those who are considering a personal vanlife expedition. i think a little backstory would be best, however if you want to just have a quick sense about it, feel free to skip to the end or just watch the images. being born and rooted in flanders, my native language is dutch. so, pardon me for my english, i’ll do my best. **background** my name is floris,  years old and i’m living in my van since january , together with my dog sauron. i graduated as a social worker and worked for , years in a youth community development project. in short i was responsible for developing a healthy community/culture in a rather tough neighborhood. building trust, bringing the youth together and support them in taking the ‘driving wheel’ of their own neighborhood and free time in a good way were the key aspects of my job. aside from that i was a reference point for all the youth and their network. any question would be good and most of their questions circled around education, work, drugs or were neighborhood related. in my free time i was and still am very passionate about wing chun, taiji, mma, hiking, being in the outdoors and spending time with my friends. i’ve always been pretty busy in sports but for the last  years it has been purely martial arts, mainly wing chun. aside from that i really love special beers and weed. in fact i’ve been smoking weed daily for the past  years and during the , years i was working i also drank some beers every evening. i didn’t drink until i was drunk but still every evening like  -  beers. those years were great but there was also an inner voice calling “ is this routine how you are going to spend all of your time from now on?”. when i was around one year into my employment the urge began to grow to experience a completely empty schedule. or rather no schedule at all, just go with the flow. to be totally free for the first time. no school stuff that you have to do to get your degree, no meetings for work that you have to be at to earn money to pay the bills and my lifestyle, nothing\*\*... how would i spend my time when i was totally free and on my own?\*\* that urge grew and grew and one year later when i had a vacation and went hiking in france it became clear to me that i just had to go for it, i would not forgive myself otherwise. i did some thinking and gave myself  years to finish my projects at work and save enough money to buy a van and gather some travel money. in those  years my plan would keep on getting more and more refined. **the travelplan/ikigai** as i said i’ve been practicing kung fu for almost  years. not in a constant manner, more in like a wave frequency. there were months where i trained weekly, other months daily, a month almost nothing and so on. however the passion never fades and youtube knew that very well. it kept feeding me lots of kung fu from masters around the world. some things i saw i just couldn’t believe, especially when it comes to the more internal skills like certain taiji masters showcase. i started to put dots on the map: who are those masters and where can i find them? and so a first kind of route developed. that combined with my passion for mountains and beautiful nature in general made the route develop further and further. the route is one thing but i was also thinking a lot about my path in general. this journey would not just be a vacation. it would be a trip of inner discovery and cultivation. pushing the hard reset button. i wanted to explore myself and my boundaries. questions like: how good do i know myself? wat is my hidden potential? when will i be sad? can i truly be happy? how big is my ego? when will i miss my family and friends? when will i miss the alcohol and the weed? when will i miss all the comforts of home? will i like it to be alone all the time? how long can i go out into the mountains with one backpack?... years ago a friend introduced me to the term ikigai. to explain in my words the ikigai is the point where  things come together: what do you love to do? what does the world need? what can you get paid for? this concept stuck with me for a lot of reasons and i think it is a big underlying factor in my motivation to do all this. being free to do what you love. skillwise the main goal is the further development of my martial art- and survival skills. that combined with the development of the more introspective qualities, true inner peace and harmony, the ultimate goal being freedom in body and mind. almost every story i heard or read about the great taiji or zen masters had something in common: they all meditated and they all talk about the essentiality of the quiet and empty mind. to be honest i have found myself to have lot of tensions in my body and mind.  years ago i thought i was a pretty chill guy, down to earth, not too big of an ego,… the more attention i gave to the matter, the more i found out that i had the wrong idea about myself. already a lot has changed but still i’m only scratching the surface of the real internal work. after watching a lot of youtube bushcrafters, hikers and survivalists in my free time i decided i would also take a camera with me and try to make some videos about my journey. it seemed like it would be cool for my friends and family, for myself and maybe even some people outside of my network. in essence i see the moviemaking as building my curriculum vitae and i’ll continue to do it as long as i enjoy doing it. begin february  i left home together with my dog sauron. it was super exiting to finally start the journey i had been planning for over  years. one side note was very important to me: plans can change. i would not force myself to do any of the things i had in mind before i left. if the training, the hiking, the meditation, the seeking out of the masters,.. didn’t come spontaneously, i wouldn’t do it. if i felt after a few months that i had misjudged all this, i would not let my pride be a factor and just go back home. **the stealth van** i won’t go too deep into this but everyone that has converted a van will probably know that is a challenging project in its own regard. the research part is a very time-consuming aspect of the vanbuild. in the beginning i thought i would keep it to a bare minimum, i just wanted a place to fall back to when things got hard. as i started researching my wishes started to change and my initial plan to keep the vanbuild to a bare minimum was thrown out of the window rather quickly. and so i bought a van (volkswagen crafter lh from ), had a design in my head and bought everything that i needed. after all the hours of preparation i finally could start the building part. after a few months, building only in the weekends, my van was finished. i learned so much during the process and awkward enough during the build i was already making plans for the second vanbuild, whenever that will be.. very important to me was that my van would be as secure and stealthy as possible. my plan was to go on longer trips with my backpack so my van would often be unguarded for longer periods of time, often with a lot valuable stuff in it. this is the reason i haven’t put in any extra windows. i also put a security film on my windows so a quick break-in would be impossible. all my doors are also heavily secured. no way to enter my van quickly if i lock it properly. **insights** \- the first month i really had to acclimate. i hiked a lot with my dog but i didn’t train so much. i did start my daily meditation training in the first week after departure. i slept terrible for a month due to the detox. the nightmares in combination with the meditation made the first month emotional pretty heavy. nevertheless it was a damn good exercise to feel all the shit from the past boiling up and letting it go. \- after a few days the thoughts about alcohol and weed were already much less. i was very amazed with that considering i was an addict for  years. the detox, the nightmares and sweating at night were a really intense wake up when it comes to acknowledging what kind of shit i had put into my system all those years. you don’t know it until you quit. after  weeks the thoughts about smoking and drinking were almost gone. when drinking a coffee it stung to not have a cigarette and even now, when i drink a beer, i instantaneously think about something to smoke. i wonder when that will fade. \- i am much more synchronized with nature when it comes to my sleeping pattern. i also need less sleep. \- in week  i did my first  hour training session, totally unscheduled. on that day i really got into the vibe i wanted to be in. in the next few days i started to train just after a short walk with sauron and breakfast. it evolved into doing my  hour (do what i have to do) session before midday so that anything that i would train in the afternoon and evening was like a bonus. it feels very good to be finished with all your most crucial to do’s early in the day. \- i started playing the digeridoo and took up my pois again. \- almost instantly i became vegetarian. mostly because i was living on a tight budget and see meat as a luxe product. since then becoming full time veggie is in my mind almost every time i eat meat. \- i started eating more healthy than ever before. i started having breakfast again, eating very healthy and zero junk food. i also gained a few kilo’s in weight, which i was happy with since i found myself a bit too skinny. \- i found out rather quickly that i didn’t need any of the things that made seemingly happy in my daily routine at home. every craving is also a form of suffering.. \- i often think about the less is more phrase. it resonates deeply. \- i enjoy the little things a lot more. activities like cooking, walking the dog, drinking a cup of tea,… it’s also like everything i eat tastes better. \- after a good month the seated practice (i can’t really call it meditation yet) started to feel deeper and i noticed that every single time after i meditate i do something useful. mostly i just rolled into another part of training. \- the videomaking and especially the making of time lapses keeps bringing me to very nice places and views. \- i started a daily vlog in english with a double functionality. to keep talking and reflecting out loud and also to practice my english. it feels right to reflect on a daily basis and capture some of it, the medium doesn’t matter. i just prefer speaking to practice my english. \- travelling with a dog is great but as everything it has its pros and cons. i can’t imagine doing this without sauron anymore though. \- in total i train between  and  hours almost every day and my training has become much more constant instead of a ‘wave frequency’. aside from that my days are filled with hiking, cooking and moviemaking and an occasional siesta. \- **the hard reset button and the change of context is working greatly. i am more disciplined and more fulfilled than ever. having a plan whilst adhering to the principle of not forcing anything and just going with the flow feels right.** this will be all for this post, i never imagined it would get so long. for all those who read the whole thing, thank you for bearing with me. i would be happy to hear any of the insights of other travelers/starting meditators or anyone else that can relate to this. below you can find some of images and videos of my journey. also, if you want to see some of the travel stories of me and sauron or you just like some experimental youtube content with no talking (yet), here is the link to my channel:

travel_ali,ihjd0k,0,1598527976,"not a single trip report, but more of a collection of experience and lessons from many trips. i don't think i have posted this here before, it might be useful in this very long planning period. most of my travel here as day or week long trips has been solo travel. this is probably as safe and easy a solo destination as you are going to get. eating isn't a group thing like in some countries, and other than maybe a few activities that require a booking with a minimal group size you won't find yourself excluded from anything. the only real factor for me regarding solo travel here has been that if you really want to meet other travelers then it will be much easier at a hostel in a more popular area than if you go off to other forms of accommodation in the lesser known regions. there are hostels all over the country, but many (especially the yhas) tend to attract domestic swiss tourists rather than an international scene. speaking the local language makes it much easier to get chatting with people, but english often works everywhere (too well given that i still have issues getting people to talk to me in german sometimes). --- **disclaimer:** * i am in no way linked to, get paid by, or benefit from anything i do on here in any way whatsoever (sadly nobody has even tried to bribe me with gifts or luxury hotel stays). this is purely for my own amusement. * i will also try and update or correct posts as i or others spot mistakes, but there could still be errors. * this is mostly aimed at english speakers, those who speak the local languages will have far more options. * i live in the german speaking area so i am very heavily biased to the sights and culture there just through my daily experience. * i am a little insufferable at always wanting to be different, so i tend to be a bit harsher on popular/famous places than unknown ones. you should try and mentally correct for that. --- **my own guides** * **my own sub:** /r/ali_on_switzerland as a convenient dumping ground for any swiss based post i make (plus they will be the more updated versions), with a slowly updated [post of places/ideas i have for future things to do.]( ) more travel related: * **travel in switzerland in general** in two posts: [new]() (mostly specific thoughts on places), and [old]() (more general information on the country as a whole). * **imgur album/info posts:** [this]( ) is the larger one which has detailed info/links and is still slowly evolving, and i also have [this]() older one which is more basic and locked.

if you have an eu plug it might not fit into a swiss socket, but newer ones should do (roughly speaking when the two prongs are mm or less in diameter, and mm apart they should work in both the eu and switzerland). * cable cars typically stop running at around pm (but can be until pm or so if it is servicing a village like mürren). this is especially deceptive in summer when it stays light until much later. check when the last run is, the internet is full of stories of people who found themselves with a long walk down in the dark. --- **internet - practical** many of these also have a phone app version which is worth having. general: * [my switzerland](). the official and very extensive tourism website. just about any information you could possibly need about anything is on here. * [wikivoyage](). a bit hit and miss: the overview and coverage for places like zürich is fantastic, but many places are lacking in useful or any info. * local tourist areas all have their own websites. usually in both summer and winter versions, giving you info on: conditions, what is open, ideas for what to do, etc:. eg: [jungfrau region](), [zermatt](), [appenzell](), and so on. transport: * you can get regional travel passes which cover all transport and cable cars in specific areas (eg: the [jungfrau region](), or the [tell pass]() around luzern). likewise there are endless [passes for museums etc in each region](). * [sbb](). the website (and also app) for the train network covering buses, boats, and cable cars too. timetables, ticket info, and pass info. it is sometimes better to look up the timetable for seasonal things like cable cars and boats on their own websites (eg: [bls boats on brienzersee](), or [cable cars in the aletsch region]()) as when they don’t run the sbb just gives a vague “can’t find the connection” notice. they do various [travel passes](), though it is best to carefully calculate your planned routes or figure out if it is worth it it is worth looking for the off-peak “super saver” tickets which limit you to a certain train but can cut the price in half (and if you have the half-tax this cuts the price again, to as much as % off). accommodation * official accommodation (which should include airbnb) will offer a guest card in many tourist areas including free/discounted local transport and activities. typically this is just in the town/village and places - minutes away ([eg for interlaken]( )), but in the beautiful and underrated canton of ticino [it covers the entire canton]( ). * aside from the standard options for finding rooms you might also want to look into other options such as , and . many smaller independent options (especially farms and rural hotels) are not on etc and you will have to find them by trawling around on google maps. this could help if you really want to stay in a certain area but everything is booked out, but many of them have a very basic setup so you might need to phone up or fill in a form on their website. * another option that might be worth considering is the [swiss hotel card]( ), a chf per year subscription that offers half priced hotel rooms. this is limited to participating hotels and doesn’t apply during the high season, but could easily pay for itself with just a single night or weekend. i have yet to try this, but the range of locations looks like it could be quite good for domestic travellers. * for more rural hut and farm based accommodation: , and , and , and . some like offer the chance to sleep on straw in a barn. * alpine huts are run by a few different organisations. [the sac website]( ) is the best starting point. * camping. standard campsites: , , and in addition there are a few websites where you can officially find a small patch to pitch up on a farm , and [on too](). * wild camping is complex. the best way to sum it up is ""prohibited but tolerated under conditions"". [this sac page has the most official guidelines]( ). there are some pointers for the ideal situation (the more you follow the better): above the treeline, with the community / landowner’s permission, [not in a protected area]( ,,,,,,,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.bglayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbezoom=topic=eche=.n=.), single tent, set up as the sun goes down and dismantle at dawn, no fire/noise/disturbance/litter. wild camping has increased in popularity in recent years, [iconic spots like seealpsee are having problems with numbers]( ), so try and pick a less known spot. weather: * for weather there is []() which also includes a few webcams and ski info in winter, or [meteoswiss]() which has a useful country map. * there are lots of high-resolution webcams. check official websites for resorts and cable cars (eg: [jungfrau region]( )), or [roundshot]( ) for the best. useful webcams can also be found at [webcamforinsiders]( ) and [swisswebcams]( ). maps: * [switzerland mobility](). detailed map showing all official routes for hiking/biking/skating…. with lots of short and long suggested routes. if you sign up for the (paid) pro version then you can plan routes on the map with detailed height information and pretty good time estimates. [for example](). * []() (mobile app - swisstopo). the official govt map is amazing. quick to load and use on desktop or mobile. you can toggle useful overlays like hiking paths (in some ways better than mobility above as the levels are shown and the contrast makes it much clearer), and just about anything else from geological features to ski runs, you can even switch to historic versions of the map going back to the mid s and watch the country grow. it will even convert any section you like to pdf for easy saving and printing. all for free. * when actually out and about i tend to use **** on my phone which has rather good coverage of the footpath system and addresses/businesses. that said it does have some big gaps in some areas. i wouldn’t use it for advanced routes, but to check my position and where a certain side path might take me it is mostly very useful. the directions feature sometimes gives good advice and sometimes decides that a perfectly good bit of path can’t be used and that you should take a  hour detour. the time calculator does not take height change into account, so do not trust that either. ------------------------------- **internet - culture** * []() swiss news and topics in english. * []() is more of the same. * [newlyswissed]() is yet more swiss news with a focus on cultural tips for those adjusting to switzerland. though it can be somewhat fluffy click-bait (actually it is mostly pretty crap really). * beer. there are apparently more breweries per person in switzerland than anywhere else in the world. the impressive one man website []() maps and is working hard to review them all. * music to get you in the mood. many of the bigger swiss artists like [anna rossinelli](), and [stefanie heinzmann]() sing in english (understandable with a slightly bigger potential audience) but there are a surprising number that sing in swiss-german. in no particular order of name or genre: [bligg]( ) (where else can you see someone rapping and posing on a zürich skyscraper?), [kunz](), [nemo](), [lo und leduc](), [dabu fantastic](), [züri west](), [baschi](), [patent ochsner](), [marc sway](), [de luca](), [müslüm](), [hedgehog](), [subzonic](), [span](), [mani matter](), [steff la cheffe](), and [dodo](). having written all that i then just found [this big youtube playlist](). or if you want to go really swiss you can go fully native and crash through into the world of [folk-schlager]() (at this point you are out-swissing most of the swiss who would run up a mountain to avoid that). [this however may be the peak of awful campy self-aware swissness]() (my apologies to every swiss person who was just reminded about the existence of that). however [this]( ) may top that to be the most amazingly bad swiss thing ever. * if you speak any of the national languages then the [swiss broadcasting corporation]( ) has plenty to offer in each. for example with german there is the srf is who do a mix of high-german and swiss-german telly and radio. [srf play]() is their on demand tv/radio website and app. they are very good at putting their full shows onto youtube - [the main srf youtube channel]() has quite a bit of content (and there are other [specialised official channels too]()). radio podcasts are on [the srf website]() and on spotify (and probably other places too), for swiss-german check srf (especially the regionaljournal channels) and srf, and for the hardcore the hörspiel channel often has full plays in swiss-german. * [i rather like the srf archive for the historical videos which can normally be enjoyed without the language.]() ------------------------------- **books** * swiss watching - diccon bewes (). switzerland seen through british eyes. a very readable and enjoyable introduction to the history, people, politics and areas of the country by someone who has lived there for years. ideal reading as a traveller. there are some over generalisations but given the scope and size it mostly does a good job. if you read anything about switzerland make it this. [he also has a google-talk video which is basically a condensed version of the book]() * slow train to switzerland - diccon bewes (). the author retraces the first thomas cook tour of switzerland and shows how much has changed since then and by the rise of trains and tourism. a very interesting read for the history and travel ideas. * around switzerland in  maps - diccon bewes ().yet another diccon book, though this is much more history and culture than travel based. at a large xcm it isn’t travel friendly either, but it is beautifully done with a range of well reproduced images and interesting information. it is accessible and interesting to everyone, but i would say this book is most enjoyable to those who already know the swiss landscape, history and culture to some extent already. the [tedx talk]() that he does on the subject is rather good. * the [bergli publisher](), which diccon is part of, have quite a few light hearted books about swiss culture and switzerland. * how the english made the alps - jim ring (). a history of how the development of tourism, climbing, and winter sports played a major role in the development of the alps. not just switzerland, but it is a major focus of the book. * a tramp abroad - mark twain (). [free ebook](). satirical and absurd account of his travels in europe. the swiss part is often hilarious. as above is interesting to see just how much the country has changed since then. several places such as [weggis-rigi]() and [zermatt-riffelberg]() have theme walks in the approximate places where he walked himself. a tramp in this sense is to walk, not the homeless person as most people other than the kiwis might assume. * sherlock holmes - the final problem - arthur conan doyle (). [free ebook](). a quick and easy read of holmes' ""final"" adventure ending at the reichenbach falls by meiringen. he oversells the waterfall somewhat though i must say. * the magic mountain - thomas mann (). inspired by and set in a davos mountain health retreat. no comment as have yet to read it. * heidi - johanna spyri (). [free ebook](). the classic kids book which seems to be something of cliché and sales-device these days ([for a start you can visit a fake heidi house in heidi village]()). it is only partly happy alpine adventures, and often rather painfully moralistic. read until she is put on a train to frankfurt and that should be enough. * william tell - friedrich schiller (). [free ebook](). performed every year in interlaken amongst other places. frankly it is really blood boring - the whole thing can be summed up that the swiss are good christian brothers, and the austrians are utter wankers. * bill bryson passes through in his  book “neither here nor there”. while still mostly a good read, being almost  years old the info is rather outdated in parts. the country has become much more lively since then for a start. * la place de la concorde suisse - john mcphee (). a very out-dated but in some ways interesting read looking at swiss military thinking and culture back in the s. the attitudes and situation are very different now over  years later. this is only really worth it if you really want to learn about that bit of swiss history. it also commits the cardinal sin of having numerous bits of french scattered about the book but with no translation provided, which is really bloody annoying. if your german is good then: * von casanova bis churchill - barbara piatti (). a series of articles about famous visitors to switzerland. * [the publisher emons does local krimis](). if you like a nice murder or two to go with your hiking spots. the quality is good enough but the writing is not going to win any literature awards."

infinitepaths,iitf3h,0,1598711845,not intending this to be a low-effort post. i have looked around and most of what i can find seems to suggest the islands are either all-out tourist bar/noise/etc or isolated areas that locals don't want you to go to (fair enough). is this simplificatin fairly accurate? is it possible to travel between the islands easily and is there a hostel scene. not intending to go until after covid btw.

Green-Impossible,iixxmj,0,1598727182,"hi, sorry for my lack of russian (am working on it), but i'm trying to find out if anyone has any info on how one might possibly get across the ukrainian border (albeit illegally/not through the road), from minsk to kyiv. i arrived in kyiv today and they denied me entry, changing the rule only yesterday! i have plans to join my girlfriend who lives here in kyiv, for a month or more. i'm a respectful citizen, and hope to move to ukraine one day, but i am not keen on letting these formalities shape my love life. now i am stuck with an option to return home, or otherwise try to cross the border from belarus, which i would like to, in a bit of a desperate situation. my idea is to buy a motorbike in minsk, and ride to the ukrainian border, break off to a small town, to the woods, and then walk across the border. i'm wondering if anyone here might know of the best/most covert place to do that, between minsk and kyiv. otherwise i will just search for any place on the map that might suit. one thing is that i cannot cross the river-border, so will have to go around it to the east or west. i don't think it should be too difficult, but does anyone know if there are any things to watch out for, along the forest border? ie. does belarus or ukraine have a giant fence separating them, or anything like that, or guards/cameras or anything along the entire border? any advice would be very much appreciated!"

rakahr11,hy36oy,0,1595750949,"i travel and work at the same time normally, so mostly because of work, i will need time to indulge myself in it and i would become pretty distant from everything. my thoughts need to be centered on the task. i am able to do other things, but being social would distract me too much from my task. also, before i got that job, i would sometimes spiral into a state of being alone. i would just focus so much on nature, the cultural sights and fauna, i would simply ""forget"" on doing more but have the occassional necessary exchange of words while buying something like food. i would find myself not having spoken to anyone for a couple of weeks, sometimes even longer. i would feel the actually need for some kind of social interaction and then it would feel awkward. like i have forgotten how to speak to people or i don't get them or they me. depending on the environment, especially when you are with fellow solo travellers, it is equally awkward but easier to engage in a conversation and keep it going. what is your experience? do you also become socially ""awkward"" over time?"

blasianseouls,hy5rld,0,1595764867,"hey guys f here. i’ve always had a longing to go to korea since i was in high school and while i was in college, i had three opportunities to go and chickened out every time because my friends backed out last minute. it really made me depressed that i was always waiting on friends to make my dream come true. last year i had another opportunity to go with friends and i finally was able to go but it was only for a few days. those five days were the best five days of my life hands down. while i was over there, i always walked around alone and explored different places because i just wanted to take everything in. (the friends i was traveling with weren’t as eager to be there as i was) i was so happy and on cloud  that i don’t remember if i was in or could have been in any danger. this brings me to my predicament at hand. since my job has become a wfh situation, i have so much time on my hands. i spoke to my boss about possibly traveling overseas somewhere and they told me they don’t mind what my background looks like on team calls, as long as my work is getting done. he also encouraged me to go as i’m getting more and more anxious from the problems going on in america right now and how we are handling everything so poorly. (i’m black and with the civil unrest so prevalent right now i fear being alone in public but that’s a whole different thread) i personally want to travel to korea for some rr but i’ve come to realize i’m terrified of going by myself and i keep thinking of what if’s. i remember korea being safe for foreigners as i never felt unsafe (but i was also too happy to even notice anything at all). my boyfriend is encouraging me to go alone because he said the best way to find yourself is a solo trip somewhere. with the way korea has handled the covid- situation, i personally would feel safer there than here in the us. the current travel situation is pretty strict with incoming foreigners; you have to quarantine at a government facility for two weeks and you have to pay anything from $-$ for the two weeks. they are now mostly hotels since the virus and incoming foreigners have dropped significantly. tickets there are very cheap, the airbnb for three weeks costs less than $ and with the only expensive piece being quarantine, i think it’s a steal. anyway, i wanted to ask if any of you guys have been to korea recently? should i take the leap of faith and go? i feel like once things go back to normal, i won’t have the same opportunity again which makes me fear that i’m going to miss out on my dream again. i don’t want to rush anything nor do i want to risk anything else. (it also doesn’t help that covid- is a thing) i just need a way of getting over the fear of traveling alone. i’ve seen way to many unsolved mysteries and true crime stories lol tldr:
how did you all overcome the solo trip fear? any advice on how to take the jump? has anyone taken a solo trip to korea recently? if so, how was it?"

billyhicks88,hyq7a6,0,1595847701,"after being stuck at home for months and with a major central asia/middle east adventure long cancelled, i thought i'd see how much of europe i could \*safely\* explore with lockdowns being eased and borders being opened. i'm /m, live in the united kingdom and travelled solo with my irish passport, acquired at the end of last year to give me more travel freedom post-brexit. my route essentially took me from estonia to italy, but it ended up being something of a zig-zag back and forth due to limited flights/train connections and uncertainty over borders being open or not - my goal was to get to see  countries which would be a new monthly record for me, so here's how it went. at the beginning of july i boarded my first flight in four months, a domestic one from london heathrow to belfast city. masks were compulsory on all flights throughout my travels and none were completely full, so if you were stuck in between two people you could easily move to an empty row with no problems. after a few (very wet) days there i got the bus down to dublin, and arrived in the week that hotels and hostels reopened again so i could stay in very quiet accommodation (i had a shared dorm all to myself), get a well-needed haircut and enjoy sitting inside a coffee place again for the first time in forever. from there i entered mainland europe flying to vienna - there was an extra line of officers before austrian passport control to check passports, where you've been in the last few days and how long you're staying. travellers from the united kingdom weren't allowed to enter without quarantine at the time (they are now), but as i'd been in ireland for several days and had my boarding pass for my next country, i was happily let in. the weather in vienna was \*stunning\*, and some attractions had heavily discounted prices as they'd just reopened again that week - the belvedere was € instead of €. i hiked around the wachau valley and took day trips to cesky krumlov/ceske budejovice in the czech republic, and sopron in hungary, all easily done as the schengen borders were open with no restrictions. masks were required on all public transport (which everyone followed) but at the time they weren't needed in shops - they've since changed the rules in austria so that they are. sleeping in vienna airport on the final night (my next flight was at am, i was happily let in airside so i could find a quiet sofa to myself rather than be stuck in arrivals) i headed on to tallinn, estonia on wizz air. this route in theory has no passport control but like austria they'd temporarily added a line of officers to check your passports at tallinn airport when you arrived. in this part of the world the virus is almost gone - cases are mostly at zero, masks and social distancing are still recommended but few need to wear them anymore and nightlife had resumed. hand sanitiser was still regularly around which i was still using just in case! i met some amazing people in my hostel, all of us excited about being the first ""post-lockdown tourists"" and we enjoyed some really good nights out in tallinn, clubs/bars were open here but restricting the amount of people who could be inside at one time. via tartu and valga/valka i went overland through latvia, seeing a bit of riga and then onto the west coast of lithuania, where i was thankful for very good weather around klaipeda as i enjoyed the beach in palanga and the curonian spit - the sand dunes at nida early in the morning were blissfully quiet and an amazing sight, and into the middle of the country i had the hill of crosses all to myself for a good few minutes. then, taking advantage of a special €. wizz air deal, i headed from vilnius down to milan, italy. i was a bit concerned about being in lombardy, both because of it being the major european epicentre of the outbreak a few months earlier, and rules stating that face masks must be worn at \*all times\* - even outdoors, and it was  degree heat! but just three days before i arrived the rules were relaxed, no masks needed outdoors anymore but still indoors on transport and in public places. it was the first time i'd been there since a family holiday  years ago, and again met some amazing new friends at the hostel (very recently reopened) who provided great company and who i hope to visit in the world when it's possible. i took a day trip to (beautiful) lugano in switzerland, and stunning lake como, the view from the volta lighthouse really is one i'll never forget. i'd previously intended to fly home from here, but instead changed my flight so i flew from milan to krakow in poland, where we were given locator forms on the flight we had to fill out which were collected later on. i headed down to zakopane and explored the tatra mountains on the polish/slovakian border, seeing a bit of the slovakian side while i was there too. despite arriving at am on a thursday, it was still surprisingly busy! hiked for about two hours to lake morskie which was an amazing sight, returning to krakow in the evening and exploring the city centre there too. then it was finally back to london! i filled out the online locator form as it was stated we had to show it to border guards when we returned, but in fact nothing of the sort happened - we just arrived at stansted, through the e-gates with no checks at all. as all the countries i'd been in for  days were on the safe list, i didn't need to quarantine on arrival. despite lots of nerves beforehand, it ended up as one of my all-time favourite travel adventures and i'm happy to have stayed safe, seen some wonderful places and met great new friends. hoping on travelling more of the world whenever it becomes possible!"
travel_timer,hyt5h1,0,1595859707,"i'm currently working full-time and i love my job, but i know that my ultimate dream is travel. i'm working as a nurse and honestly working during covid has really solidified my desire to travel, and live abroad. i just want to see and experience as much of the world as i possibly can. i made a previous post about how much i think about travel. the more i think, the more places i want to visit and my post covid trip route grows longer and longer. my current plan is travel from southeast asia, up through the middle east, then to europe, through the balkans, and ending in france and spain. i'm figuring this will take about  months to do. and i'm so excited. but other times, that seems like a looong time to be away. so i'm wondering what other people's experiences of longer long-term travel have been. did you get sick of travel at a certain point? do you wish you had done things differently?"

(i don’t need legitimate schooling, my degree is already advanced and i will want a break, lol) - what types of things can i do? i do know i want to go to some of the typical tourist attractions - like hallgrímskirkja, and the blue lagoon. i would love to drive the ring road (i think it’s called??) but i don’t know too much about that. - anything else that’s relevant, really. please don’t make warnings about covid since this trip will be in two to three years and i do not need to think about travel cautions for that right now. i’m just trying to estimate expenses to try and save as much as i can. i don’t really have a budget as of yet, since i’m still figuring out logistics and don’t know how much i’ll be able to save/spend, if that makes sense. thank you!!!"

so if covid is done, i’m hoping next spring () i will be able to go on my first solo trip to europe. at first i was going to do  weeks, but decided i wanted to throw barcelona and ibiza in there, so i want to do  weeks now. most places i have worked offer  weeks vacation time, which in canada is very normal and standard, but i see people on here who can leave work for a month and it’s all good. only issue is my job i recently had, laid me off due to covid. so ideally i will find a new job, but if everything is all good by next spring, i want to go on a trip. how have you asked your boss, or even new boss to get a good amount of time off? i also want to visit vegas for a few days in the summer as i’ll be  and able to finally go. so really i need almost  weeks. any advice or tips? thank you!"

iminhy,hz7ozp,0,1595909041,"# partly making this post now because i finally finished editing all of my video clips. check out this final video [here!]() **intro:** i was an american m that quit my job to start graduate school in fall , but took a two-week solo trip in between to japan in august. i visited tokyo, mt. fuji, hakone, kyoto, hiroshima, osaka, and nara. note that one of the goals of my trip was to film different aspects of japan for a video montage, so this trip report might be geared towards that. total trip cost : \~$ usd (including flight). **days - (tokyo):** flew in via japan airlines (/) and checked-in my luggage with wise-owl hostel (/). my favorite ramen place was ramen hayashida in shinjuku. tsukiji fish market was also really nice for small but very diverse eats. favorite temple was the sensoji temple, but go at night since it's less crowded and pictures look so much better! do note that the lights turn off after a certain time (i think -pm) so don't go too late. another must is the teamlab planets tokyo museum. i'd choose it over teamlab borderless if you don't have time for both. least favorite place was the tokyo imperial palace since it was under construction. for aerial views of shibuya crossing, you can get a decent view from the top of magnet by shibuya  (mag's park) for  yen. ginza crossing is also a nice aerial view and is less populated. i was able to get to the top of the building across from the fujiya building for free, and it was not crowded at all. **days - (mt. fuji**): august is the hottest time of the year, so be forewarned. but the upside is that mt. fuji is open for climbing. note that mt. fuji does not have it's snowy tip since it's all melted, this is something i did not anticipate for photos. anyhow, i'm not an avid climber but am decently fit and found it somewhat challenging. do your research on proper hiking and gear beforehand; don't hike it unprepared (shoes and poles). i took a bus from tokyo to mt. fuji th station and climbed the yoshida trail for up to the th station where i rested for a few hours at the tomoekan (th station) hut which i reserved a month in advance. in hindsight, an th station hut might have been a better pit stop. i woke up at :pm and continued the hike until i reached the top at sunrise, where the temperature dropped to about °c. best view of my life (see video). the hike up was  hours total and hike down was  hours. the hike down was brutal since the trail was filled with ash and the sun was blazing. still worth it though. **days - (hakone):** took a bus to hakone, which is known for its onsens. i didn't explore the onsens much but wish i had since it would have been really nice after a long hike. i stayed at emblem hotel flow, which was okay and they had their own onsen which i thought was lackluster. i mainly went to hakone to see lake ashi and the hakone shrine. go early if you want to avoid the line for pictures!. otherwise the lake itself is a great view and you can rent a paddle boat. at night, there was a firework festival over the lake which i unfortunately missed. **days - (kyoto):** took the shinkansen from odawara to kyoto and stayed at piece hostel sanjo, which was right next to the niski market which i loved. kyoto is much quieter and very ""japan"" as it's known for its shrines and temples. fusimi inari, kinkaku-ji , hokan-ji to name a few. arashiyama was also nice for the bamboo forest (which i thought was a bit over-hyped since it was smaller than i thought) and the monkey park. if you're up for a thrill, i met up with another redditor and hiked fushimi inari at night time. much different experience since it was less crowded but also a whole different (scary) vibe. one place i wanted to go was hirobun and the nearby kifune shrine, which was a bit farther north. one thing i'd also recommend trying is to rent a bike to get around! my favorite food spots were okinomiyaki katsu (a small but nice neighborhood mom pop spot) and menbaka fire ramen which puts on a nice fire show for you. **days - (osaka):** i realized during my trip that it was august , the anniversary of the hiroshima bombing. there was toro nagashi (lantern festival) happening, so i spontaneously booked a shinkansen ($$$) to hiroshima and spent the night there at the lantern festival. met up with a few redditors from [r/japantravel]() for a couple of drinks afterwards :). **day  (nara):** a day trip to nara is easily doable as it is only \~hr away from osaka or kyoto. there are deers everywhere in throughout nara park. they wander aimlessly throughout the park/city. todai-ji is also a great temple to visit in the area too. if you get the chance, check out the famous two men pounding mochi at nakatanidou. **days - (osaka):** i'd say osaka stood out to me at the place for nightlife. i went on an osaka pub crawl which was super fun. just a bunch of other travelers getting together for a fun night out in osaka for a few yen. dontonburi is really nice during the night, so check that out. osaka castle was as expected. the aquarium is cool too for some video shots but it was very crowded. kuromon market was my favorite fish market in the entire trip! **day  (tokyo):** not sure why i didn't fly out of osaka instead of tokyo but hindsight is /. spent this day to wind down and pack some souvenirs. also took this chance to stay in one of those capsule hotels. i chose nine hours in tokyo, which was a very interesting experience. the capsules are actually a lot roomier than i had thought. **final thoughts:** suica/pasmo card is a must. a debit card without transaction fees (i used capital one ) is also very helpful to withdraw yen on the spot. every convenient store had an atm, so this was easy. i had $ in the account and that was more than enough. a coin purse is also very helpful since cash is king and you'll be getting a lot of coins back. i took extra precautions with a travelling belt to hold my valuables (i.e. passport), but overall my impression of japan was that it was very safe and the people there were always very willing to help tourists. august is also one of the hottest times to travel (c/f on most days) so i had to take breaks during the day in the hostels or convenient stores. however another upside of this season is that there were many firework festivals (i went to about three in each city). i didn't need to know any japanese other than ""thank you."" if you plan to climb mt. fuji, plan ahead of time and do your research. also, if you are a solo traveler, don't hesitate to meet people you meet in the city, hostels, or even on reddit! they were a large part of the experience for me! remember to check out my [**video**]() as it gave me a lot of nostalgia editing it!"

Davidyhealetsgo,hzh1ye,0,1595951385,"i am dutch, and let me tell you we dutch people have a lot of good food that you wouldn't normally be able to get anywhere else on the world without doing some real searching. so this is a list of foods you should definitely look out for next time you visit the netherlands. [**oliebol**]() the famous dutch oliebol, which translates into: 'oilball' is a delicious snack that you can only get when you visit during the winter. the preparation of an oliebol is actually very simple but the taste is really good. an oliebol is practically just donut dough made into a ball and then fried until the outside is brown. but this is not where it normally stops. many people decide to put a little bit of poedersuiker (powdered sugar) over it and that really finishes it off, or if you want to go for the real traditional oliebol you have to put raisins in the dough before frying. this snack is for the people that really enjoy a warm ""snack"" during the winter. [**stroopwafel**]() some of you might already know this one. seeing how the stroopwafel has made its presence on some international occasions, but for those of you who don't know this one let me explain. a stroopwafel is literally what it translates into a syrup waffle. and let me tell you a nice warm stroopwafel during the afternoon is the real dream. you can buy these in the general supermarkets with all kinds of flavors: chocolate, salted, etc. but the real strooopwafel is the one you can get on the market at a [stroopwafel stand]() who make one live for you right there, where the syrup drips from the waffle into your napkin. [**(broodje)kroket**]() dutch people really like their fast-food, but dutch fastfood looks slightly different from the american variant. although you can also get burgers and chicken nuggets. the real dutch snack is a nice bamischijf or in this case kroket. a kroket is basically a meat ragout with a fried coating. there isn't much else to add to that, other than saying that a nice kroket on some bread is a perfect meal when going out. [**hagelslag**]() hagelslag is another typical dutch thing that you won't see fast in other places in the world. hagelsslag isn't necessarily something you'd eat by itself. more so as a ""topping"" on your bread. we dutch people really like bread. and more so with some good toppings like peanut butter chocolate paste or hagelslag. chocolate sprinkles made to put on your bread, perfect, and ""healthy"" breakfast. [**haring**]() dutch people are really good at managing water. and with that, we learned that we could eat a lot of things that came out of that water. our favorite: the haring. a slippery eel-like fish with some sour after-taste. and although this might sound like some weird swedish delicacy (which it partly is) we [dutch people sure like a nice haring]() after a long day at the beach or another sea-related activity. [**pannenkoeken**]() pannekoeken (pancakes) isn't something very original or dutch, but i thought i'd mention it anyway because the way we eat our pancakes might be very different from the way you do it. we do not like thick pancakes stacked on top of each other with some syrup and butter, no. the only real and dutch way to bake pancakes is by grabbing your biggest pan, baking the pancake thin as paper, and stacking  on top of each other so the whole family can grab one. our toppings do not differ much but a pancake with cheese or bacon is also really good! [**stamppot**]() just like the oliebol is this something you won't see much unless you visit during the winter. when everyone is crawled up in their homes and is enjoying the warmth and coziness of their thermostat while it's snowing outside. during these times dutch people resort to some of our favorite dishes: zuurkol, boerenkool, hotspot, and many more. which all can be names stamppot, a collective name. stamppot is usually a big casserole type of dish made with not more than four or five ingredients, but every stamppot must have potatoes and a kankworst (big sausage). [**een bakje met nootjes**]() last not but least een bakje met nootjes (a bowl with nuts). every dutch bar or restaurant has one at its bar. a dirty glass bowl filled to the brim with peanuts or borrelnootjes (peanuts in a crusty coat), it's not usually something you'd order but you grab a couple when you leave the bar after you ordered some drinks. the dirty side about this is that you're of course not the only one that grabbed a couple of nootjes when you went to grab a drink, and the people that run the place aren't switching the bowl out just because you grabbed a few. so when you do go to a dutch bar make sure you never go for the last borrelnootjes or peanuts at the bottom of the bowl, unless you want three types of diseases. well, this was a list filled with some of my favorite and some weird food we eat here in the netherlands and that you should definitely try out when you come here. i hope you enjoyed the list, and keep in mind to never go for the last borrelnootjes. if you'd like to see more of this type of content be sure to check out r/travelupdates where people post similar content about their country or places they've visited"

i went out today and saw a gentleman in his garage next to one of the houses for sale, so i just asked him how he finds the area and ended up having a nice  or  minute conversation with him.
i realised after there is no way i would have done this  years ago before my st solo trip.

girlgirly,hzx0gv,0,1596011250,"i really want to go to egypt. it has always been my dream and i will probably go alone. the thing is that everyone keeps saying that it's a dangerous place for women. i'm moroccan but i've lives my whole life in europe. and i've traveled alone to marrakech. the things i did for security in marrakech were: dressing like women there, making sure i'm on the hotel before sunset and avoiding areas with no tourists. and if i did go out at night but with a group of other tourists i meet. i feel like doing this i was safe. and also i wouldn't go with my camera out, i would take pictures and stuff but while i wasn't using it i would put it back in my backpack. i've read in a survey a few years ago that out of all touristic countries morocco is the second one most dangerous for women. and egypt is number one. and i've traveled to morocco with no problem. so i should be alright going to egypt? i didn't know. if someone has been to morocco and egypt it would be nice if you could tell me if it's any different. and also i know that if you're european or asian you probably had a different experience. me being moroccan probably made things easier for me. but i still would like to know how other women experienced the country by themselves."

FrenchBowler,hg9qp4,0,1593185521,"i figured since travel is at an all time low, i'd share my story from ireland. i hope it's allowed. thanks for reading! it was august , and i was gaining my first experience as a solo traveler. while based in a small, two-pub town in county kildare, i traveled the countryside by day and spent nearly every night at the cozy local pub down the road from my cottage. my first night there, i met a man named pat. he was  years old at the time, and i was . over the following two weeks pat and i spent our nights chatting away over seemingly endless pints of guinness. in his younger days he was a premier league football coach and he shared countless tales with me. he gave me sage advice which led me through a transitional period in my young life. he taught me how to drink guinness (in three gulps, but you order your next pint after the second gulp). we grew close during our time together, so much so that on my last night in ireland he and the other friends i had made at the pub wouldn’t let me leave. we stayed until close and even a bit after. i ran out of (cash) euro’s, but my new friends insisted that i stay so they paid for my pints. they made me promise that i would come back to the pub to see them, and of course i obliged. fast forward three and a half years, and my family in ireland was hosting a large family gathering for st patrick’s day . i was elated upon hearing the news. not only would i be going to ireland with my brother jon, but i could also reunite with patrick and introduce my brother to all my friends in county kildare. our first night at the cottages i took jon down to the local pub, and all around me were familiar faces. i smiled and nodded at everyone while looking around for pat. his seat at the bar was empty and he wasn’t out back with the smokers. after searching the pub, i found a young woman who i had met on my last stay. i asked if she knew pat, and the color instantly drained from her beautiful face. she glanced up at a photo hanging above the bar. instantly i knew what this meant. i was too late. i had waited too long. my promise to return was unfulfilled. few moments in my life compare to what i had felt that night. i lost focus on everything around me and slowly backed up to exit the pub. i didn’t want to be caught crying in front of friends and family alike. jon had followed me out and helped get me back to the cottage. that night i wept myself to sleep, and when i awoke it felt like a piece of my soul was missing. my brother poked his head in to let me know he was heading down to the café with some of our family for breakfast. i told him i’d meet up in a bit, even though i felt like doing nothing. eventually i put myself together and walked into town. i entered the café and a large table was occupied by my brother and some extended family. everyone looked up me. before i could say anything, jon stood up, grabbed my arm, and said “u/frenchbowler..”. the tone of his voice was serious, but with a slight quiver to it. i could tell something was up. “… i was walking along the canal this morning thinking about last night, and i saw a piece of trash on the ground. i don’t know why, but i decided to pick it up. is…is this pat?” i took the laminated piece of paper from him. it was heavily tattered and worn, but sure enough the man in the picture was my old friend pat. it was his memorial card from his funeral- dated january nd, . * months prior* to this moment. “i have to admit, when i saw this… i was shook.” shook was certainly one word for it. i however felt an overwhelming sense of fulfillment and joy. as my eyes swelled up i knew everything was okay, and so did pat. tl;dr i met an older gentleman named pat on one of my first solo travel experiences. . years later i went back to see him, but he had since passed. the next morning my brother found his memorial card laying on the ground along the canal near where pat and i had met. it was pat’s way of letting me know that he knew i had come back to see him like i promised."
vicky10129,hgapku,0,1593188638,"a little context: i will be travelling to the middle east/africa in a few months and have been doing lots of research on solo female travelling and the customs. i will be going to egypt, jordan and isreal with a possible extension to turkey (haven't decided if im going to europe yet). i've seen a lot of posts about how to dress however many of them are dated and well, to be blunt, the women posting about it are generally white, or at least very western looking. i am not white. i'm not of arab decent either but for some reason i get mistaken as one a lot ( specifically morrocan or egyptian). i don't see it but whenever i travel or even in my every day life i get spoken to in arabic or asked if i am egyptian/morrocan but its only people of those backgrounds asking. also i tend to wear headscarves ( im not religious i just like to cover my hair). and because of that i am wondering how i should dress. i have two options: a: i dress like a tourist. im not one to wear revealing clothing so i'd be bringing pants and long skirts with tshirts/long sleeves and probably some sneakers. and i would purposely add a keychain of a canadian flag to my bag to stick out as a tourist because i read theyre more lenient with tourists. or
b: i dress more in a middle eastern style to ""blend in"". and by doing so i would assume i wouldnt get any unwanted attention as they wouldnt think i'm a tourist. what are your thoughts? sorry for the long paragraphs but thanks for reading!!"

Daz00,hge66b,0,1593199554,"i wrote a piece on here a while back in defence of my home city, which seems to get a bad rep on on here as being “souless” or “just another city” so i’ve decided to update it with better and new information, and better structure. hope you enjoy, and hopefully we can all get back to travelling soon! the average trip to dublin seems to go as follows: book of kells, guinness storehouse, temple bar. a package of disappointment usually rolled into . days before moving onto galway or london. dublin is amazing because of its people, snugs and pubs, it’s tradition of literature, it’s booming underground music scene, coziness, beautiful parks and thriving vintage fashion. it’s a place that can be seen in two days, but not experienced. we lack the jaw dropping ornate colonial architecture or towering monuments of many other european cities, but we make up for it in stories, in character, and in the people of dublin themselves. the first most important step to enjoying dublin is freeing yourself from expectations. this is a city, it’s not going to be like the romanticised irish countryside. it is relatively small, so it lacks the same bustle and amenities of berlin or london. life is slower and simpler than much of the rest of europe, while contrasting with a cosmopolitan vibe. *enjoy the real pubs of dublin* *quick note. sitting at the bar, you will be engaged in conversation by strangers. sitting in a booth or table is a sign to others you want to be left alone. most tourists end up going to temple bar, spending € on a pint and finding that “historic pub” was founded  years ago, only visited by tourists and you’re now broke. temple bar should be avoided for its pubs, though it does offer other reasons to visit. having one pint at a famous pub is a great way to meet other travellers, just after gathering a group head out and explore dublin’s great, and more affordable pubs! * john kavanagh’s/gravediggers pub. located beside the historic glasnevin cemetery, and near the botanic gardens, this local haunt is famous among dubliners but usually without many tourists. has a beautiful historic interior.
* the cobblestone in smithfield, a short walk from the traditional dublin area of stonneybatter, this pub has free irish music almost every night which is aimed toward a local crowd. * lannigans on eden quay is decked out in halloween decor all year which has been collected over the decades, pints €.. there are two pubs, the one on the right is better and has a more impressive interior.
* thomas house. this thomas st pub is located in the working class liberties district of dublin, near christchurch. it is the home of dublin’s punk, ska, and general alternative scene of dublin. * fibber mcgees is a rock and metal bar popular with dublin’s alternative crowd. lovingly known as fibbers by dubliners.
* mary’s bar and hardware/wowburger: iconic dublin retro diner restraunt hidden in the basement of a pub that also functions as a hardware shop. what’s not to love?
* o’donoghues and neighbouring nesbitts on merrion row have beautiful snugs and interiors, great hidden gems. snugs are partitioned wooden rooms in a pub, originally for women to drink in privacy they survive because of the cozy privacy they offer for everybody. * g.p grogans between george’s st arcade and castle market is where all the artsy - year olds hang out. great pub, frequented by great people.
* the long hall, a victorian heritage pub.
* the bernard shaw in phibsborough, and its food/beer garden. draws a young crowd. * honourable mentions: the flowing tide, john fallon’s, the international bar, the wild duck, the boar’s head, kehoes. walk  minutes in any direction away from temple bar, you will find a good pub. *what attractions are worth it?* it seems a lot of dublin’s most popular attractions are pretty mediocre, or not worth the wait or price. luckily dublin has an abundance of great things to do. most of which are free, which is why they’re not advertised by tour companies or the tourist board. * kilmainham gaol is not free, but it is a must do. tickets must be bought in advance. while in the area visit the war memorial gardens, the museum of modern art, the phoenix park which has a native deer population.
* capelizod village is also nearby, it has a quaint village feel, just five minutes from the city. nearby is the scenic strawberry beds, which feels like stepping back into the s with iris large derelict factories, greenery and quaint houses. * the jameson and guinness distillery are both supposed to be good.
* the rha (royal hibernian academy) is a free modern art museum, located on a beautiful georgian street juxtaposed between merrion square and stephens green. * the dead zoo is a museum on merrion square with a massive collection of dead insects, birds, mammals etc, in its original cluttered victorian layout. totally free, a rare example of an original victorian museum layout. * the national gallery at merrion square. nearby the museum of archeology on kildare st is a palladian architectural marvel, and the first place dublin’s different social classes could intermix freely. contains beautiful celtic golden jewellery, bodies preserved in bogs, viking artefacts, and egyptian and cypriot relics. * george’s st arcade, europe’s oldest shopping centre. * medieval dublin. at audeon’s church explore a less visited medieval church for free, where you can see the unearthed remains of dublin’s old streets. behind it you can find the still functional medieval city gate, unknown even to many dubliners. on the northside explore the crypts of st michan’s church, where you can touch a mummified crusader for good luck. there are various old churches up and along thomas street, some of which are now breweries. * cheater beatty library and dubhlinn gardens: this free to enter museum of islamic and east asian art was donated to the people of ireland by a american billionaire. located in the beautiful dubh linn (blackpool) gardens behind the castle from where the city gets its name. * the parks and canals of dublin. the phoenix park is europe’s largest walled park. home to a native deer herd, the city zoo, victorian tea houses and miles of meadow and forest, rent a bike and explore it for a few hours. merrion square is a grand georgian park square, home to the oscar wild monument, it’s a more tranquil stephens green. st stephens green is the heart of dublin, and around the corner the iveagh gardens are one of dublin’s best secrets. with a rose garden, maze, two large fountains, ruined statues, a beautiful waterfall. the iveagh gardens are dublin’s most romantic and peaceful park. just south is the grand canal, separating the city centre from its dense posh victorian suburbs of rathmines, ranelagh and ballsbridge. it’s peaceful, green and dotted with canal boats. walk it’s length from dublin’s modern dock lands to portobello or vice versa.
* botanic gardens/glasnevin cemetary. located right beside one another, you could spend the best part of a day between them. i reccomend a guides tour of glasnevin cemetary, one of irelan’s most historic places. the botanic gardens are a stunning example of victorian greenhouses, with a lillypod lined river seemingly ripped out of a french impressionist painting. * higgins figgis, dublin’s oldest bookshop. the winding stairs bookshop. ha penny bridge and merchants arch medieval gateway. general nightlife •the workman’s club is arguably a club, a pub and a place to catch a good gig. it’s the perfect package really. if you like hip-hop, s music, punk, indie, rock they have seperate floors with seperate themes. you can usually catch a local or international act here for €-€. the smoking level also has a dublin-famous wowburger which is not to be missed! *visit the markets* shop for food cheap on moore st, but sadly those markets are a shell of their former self. head up through the liberties up thomas st especially on a saturday afternoon and you’ll pass countless stands selling everything from bananas, chocolate, tissue roll to weed grinders for affordable prices. then head up meath street to the liberty markets building (thurs-sat) and grab a vegetarian pizza from lucky’s! howth market is nice too, if pricy. *visit antique shops* plenty dotted around, especially in and around johnston’s court which is lined with jewelers. the basement of grays with its narrow staircase, and under the bridge on talbot st are among my favourites. *go vintage shopping* dublin has a massive amount of charity shops and specialized vintage clothing shops. walk up camden street, south great george’s st and capel street, phibsborough and you’ll pass dozens. i recommend the kilo vintage shop in the basement of lucy’s lounge vintage shop and play an arcade game while you’re down there. i got a s rave jacket in here for € mint condition. price based on weight. tola always has an amazing selection as does flip(helter skelter), which is great for punk gear too. sharpsville is one of the og vintage places in dublin as is flip. nine crows has great low price racks in the back off baggot st, with everything € or under. *catch a gig or go to the theatre* what i love about dublin most of all is the small gigs in the basement or back room of century old buildings, you can feel the music vibrating through the floor up through your body. the music scene in dublin right now is at its best in a long long time and has something to offer everybody. the best venues for local acts or even just cheap acts in general are the workman’s club, thomas house, vicar street, the academy, whelans.
acts like the murder capital, fontaine’s dc, girlband, kojaque, versatile are all blowing up right now. it’s a great place to be musically. i really recommend immersing yourself in dublin’s deep history with plays and theatre by going to an irish play, either from the th century or more contemporary. the abbey is our national theatre but many smaller theatres have the same shows for half the price and a more personal setting, such as the viking theatre in clontarf which is owned by the pub below it (bring up a pint!) and a few hidden through the city and dun laoighre. *visit dublin’s outter neighbourhoods* tourists seem to think dublin only exists between christchurch and merrion square, but the life of it exists right beyond those borders. you’ll find the pace immediately slows down, everything becomes more local and tourists disappear from sight. it’s what i’d describe as ‘proper dublin’. “howth” the perfect day trip.  minutes/€ on the train. start by exploring the pier, and it’s many fishmongers. stop for tea in the dog house, beneath an absorbed elevated tram platform. explore the grounds of howth castle, with its meadows and forests, and behind the hotel where a portal tomb flown sits in a rheodedandron garden (so beautiful i specifically recommend visiting dublin in late may/early june just to see it in bloom) and traverse through this flowering, jungle like garden up a hill to the top for panoramic views of howth, dublin bay and the far-off dublin mountains. visit ireland’s eye by boat, to get a glimpse of the west coast. try find the abandoned church! back on the mainland get a bus to the summit, and hike to the bailey lighthouse. decend to a hidden beach or continue rightward towards sutton along the cliffs, with several more secret beaches on the way (easy to miss, keep an open eye) “camden st” a centre of local nightlife, and several graffiti filled alleyways (liberty lane, camden row, camden place,) and murals line the street, this is the centre of much of dublin’s local nightlife, generally a great street with something for everybody. walk south and you’re in rathmines, walk north and you’re in george’s st, parliament st and capel st, all of which are worth visiting) “stonneybatter” a traditional street and area, a mix of working and middle class, home to traditional shopfronts, good food spots and cafes and pubs. “phibsborough, south glasnevin, drumcondra” gritty phibsborough is great for pubs, charity shops and a walk around. home to the blessington basin, a beautiful secluded park and several hipster haunts. south glasnevin is centred around the botanic gardens, with a breezy red brick traditional feel. a coffee at mcmahons is great if only to look at the traditional shopfronts before walking around the botanic gardens. drumcondra is the best of all worlds, with dense urban bustle to the south, a large leafy avenue with several residential side streets with a few hidden cafes, an the beautiful griffith park where you can put your feet in the river and relax for the evening. “clontarf and fairview” clontarf is home to the bull island unesco listed nature reserve, connected to the mainland by a wooden bridge, which also hosts a multi kilometre long beach and coffee outpost “happy out”. clontarf also contains st anne’s park, former estate of the guinness family which is dotted by abandoned tea temples and various hidden ruins. clontarf castle and st john the baptist cemetary are nice to walk around. clontarf promenade is also beautiful to walk along “rathmines and ranelagh” middle class victorian suburbs on the grand canal, within walking distance of the city centre, a look at authentic dublin. lots of nice bakeries, chippers, pubs, cafes, restaurants. “portobello” a beautiful wealthy residential district near the grand canal nice to walk a round “malahide” a wealthy suburb accessible by train or bus. home to a large marina, a castle and parkland, a quaint town centre with great food options. also home to a beach of its own, and nearby portmarnock beach. “dun laoghaire, dalkey and killiney” dun laoghaire is a short hop on the train from the city centre. a regional centre of the suburbs, it has a strong town centre and a large harbour with a beautiful pier walk. nearby is the forty foot, where dublin’s regularly jump into the sea and the james joyce museum located in an old martello tower fortification. take the train south (or walk) to uber wealthy dalkey to explore it’s beautiful village centre which hosts multiple castles. nearby killiney hill is a beautiful walk, as is vico road, a coastal road home to dublin’s ultra wealthy. have a picnic on killiney beach. *good coffee spots* *books upstairs, a beautiful and peaceful cafe over a bookshop with a window seat that hangs over the street. *joy of cha. cosy tea house with a large shelf full of teas for you to chose from. *simons place. a s style cafe. popular with creatives, students, business people. filled with posters and charm, and most importantly lunch and coffee for €.. *silk road cafe in the chester beatty library has a revolving menu of dishes from the nations the museum’s art originates from. dublin is a dirty city, no doubt. and our nation is struggling with a major homelessness crisis, but it’s not even a fraction on the level of say vancouver. it’s not the countryside, we can’t stop for everybody but to say it’s too fast paced i think is flat out wrong. people seem to come here and expect the countryside because of the conotations of ireland, but it’s a very urban side to ireland that doesn’t exist elsewhere in the republic. it’s different to the rest of the country. if you’re expecting kerry from dublin you’re not going to enjoy it. if you have any questions or want me to elaborate on anything, about ireland in general, please ask away. hope this has been a good resource for when the pandemic is over."

Fmanow,hgp779,0,1593243019,"so i was watching under the tuscan sun the other day, and it occurred to me the protagonist travels to italy solo and ends up living there. similar thing happens with midnight in paris, except the main character ends up solo after traveling with his fiancé, again ends up living in france. the common denominator with the main characters is they're both authors and seemingly independently wealthy or at least finances are a non issue for the purposes of their trips. these ideas of uprooting and traveling to a foreign land are romantic and strike a chord, but don't seem practical unless you have the means to pull it off. at least with these movies."

doughqueen,hgz5yi,0,1593284063,"hi everyone! i wasn't going to write about this trip because it was my first one, not super well-planned and not very eventful. but, i'm stuck here in houston for the long-foreseeable future and wanted to relive some happier times so here we go! i took my first solo road trip from houston, texas to santa fe, new mexico from january -, . it was completely on a whim after a rough first semester at graduate school so, like i said, it wasn't super well-planned. luckily i have some friends in alpine, texas because i went to undergrad out there for a semester so i didn't have to do the drive all in one day (and got to have a great catch-up with some friends!). i was a little nervous because i'm a young female but it ended up going so well. so here is my schedule from those days, and i will follow it with some reflections and pictures: day : drove from houston to alpine, texas. i took i-. i chose this route over the north route because, like i said, i have friends there so i wouldn't have to pay for a place to stay overnight and i definitely wanted to take a break for safety reasons as i wasn't sure what road conditions would be like going into santa fe. stayed in alpine overnight, nothing too eventful. day : drove from alpine to white sands, new mexico and spent an hour or two in white sands. then drove from white sands to truth or consequences, new mexico. visited the brewery and bought some beer then finished my drive to santa fe. got to my airbnb at like... pm i think? then went to get dinner at a nearby cafe where i tried red and green chile for the first time. day : started my morning by going to the santa fe railyard and farmer's market. went to the second street brewery (as you can probably tell, i like beer), tried some brews and took a bottle home. visited an art gallery in the area. went to the santa fe plaza and walked around for a long time, visiting art galleries, the church and some shops. had lunch at the shed (amazing!) and then went to the georgia o'keefe museum. finished the evening by doing some work at a local coffee shop (i may have had dinner somewhere, but i truly can't remember and you'll find out why shortly). day : went to museum hill and visited the museum of indian arts and culture which i loved after an early lunch at the museum hill cafe (overpriced tbh). went to the emergency room because i had been getting progressively more sick over the past couple days (i thought it was just a cough from going into the dry air/higher altitude, and i tested negative for both flus and strep. so still a mystery). went to meowwolf and then had dinner at a sushi restaurant that i don't think i could ever remember the name of. but they gave me a free soup because my voice sounded really bad. went back to the airbnb praying to feel a little better before driving home in the morning. day : left my airbnb around am and began my drive to austin, where i have family to stay with. i drove for like  hours straight i think? and on some level i'm honestly surprised that i made it. my cough ended up being so horrible that my ribs and back were aching terribly that night. then i headed the rest of the way home the next day. okay, whew. i think i crammed in a heck of a lot in those few days and yes, i was sick for a lot of it. i honestly have no clue what happened because i wasn't around anyone who was sick before i left and no one got sick when i got home. some regrets that i have were, well, being sick. i also wish that i had someone to go to white sands with because i was too scared to go too far into the dunes without someone to navigate with. it was still gorgeous and amazing but i definitely want to go back with someone. same goes for meowwolf, it was really awesome but even though i went in with the intention of following the story line, i ended up just wandering around because i was too overwhelmed to try and figure it out. i had plenty of hand sanitizer on me plus i had throat lozenges in my mouth the whole time so i didn't do a whole lot of coughing while i was there. i also wanted to go to some springs or some parks but didn't have the time. the drive back was really stressful because of how sick i felt, and i'm sad that i had to rush to austin because i passed through some really cool looking small towns on the way out of new mexico, including the town with the billy the kid museum and grave. so bummed i couldn't stop there but i had fun looking up the towns on my stops. other than that though, i loved every second of it. it had freshly snowed when i got there, and it was enough snow that i got to see some beautiful views but not enough that it made it dangerous to drive. the museums and art galleries i visited were amazing. i also stayed at a great airbnb in this huge house with several guests staying in it. the owner is an artist and him and his wife were so kind. i only wish i had gotten to get to know them and the other guests more, but i mostly holed myself up in my room because i felt pretty crappy by like day . i also discovered how much i love driving long distances, which i was nervous about because i'm a generally anxious person and have trouble being alone with my thoughts so i wasn't sure how well i would tolerate it. plus i had a lot of great film photography practice out there and got some great beers! speaking of photography, while i was in the plaza i met an older man who noticed my camera and we had a chat about film photography for about a half hour. he gave me his recipe for homemade film developer and we followed each other on social media. just a funny story that i like to look back on. i met some super nice people there. as far as budget goes, i saved a lot of money on the way there by bringing my own food. i brought some uncrustable sandwiches, applesauce pouches, water and fruit snacks. i think i brought other stuff too but i can't remember. my airbnb was affordable too, i think i only spend $ for the three nights i was there and it was the perfect accommodation for me. the meowwolf ticket was a little expensive, but i didn't spend all that much on food while i was there either because i only ate - actual meals per day. other food that i ate was more like snack. they have some amazing food in santa fe. of course, now i have some medical bills to take care of. blah. but the people at st. vincent's were some of the nicest nurses and doctors i've ever met and made me feel so much safer because being alone in a strange city while sick is super scary! so if you're gonna be sick in santa fe and there's no urgent care clinics open, i recommend them (lol). overall, i loved the trip and i never once felt unsafe, which was a concern not so much for me but for my family and friends. if you're a young lady looking for somewhere in the us to visit solo for the first time, santa fe is a great option. and finally, here's a few of my favorite mm shots i took on the trip! none are edited so if they don't look super clean and professional, i'm sorry lol []() i'd be happy to answer any questions about the trip!"
anguslearns2do,hgzyg7,0,1593286698," to circle southern half of germany in  days, i let go settling along river rhine. after heidelberg, i short-break in offenburg and freiburg and head directly to weil am rhein. weil am rhein is great choice for solo travel in my opinion. it’s right at the triple border of france, switzerland, and germany. hopping across the  countries for junk food is really really fun. besides, accommodation is very economical (by cad$, i check-in a real hotel that can see switzerland from my room with unlimited smoked salmon in the included buffet breakfast). scenic points may be limited within the city. consider vitro design museum. it can be a great surprise. amazing designs cover all aspects of life. when i feel hungry and check time, i spent  hours in it already. totally mind refreshing. rate ./ \*note: if you have time, try the $ full tour. it seems you can access the factory building and witness production lines of many famous products. if you do, please share the experience with me. #xb; "
charlykatbat,hh026c,0,1593287044,"hello you beautiful people.
as  is one hell of a weird year i had to make some drastic changes in my summer planning.
my original plan was to fly to scotland and hike the west highland way and then continue on the east highland way (in total around  km). but since corona i decided to scrap that plan.
i still want to go hiking this year, so i started looking into alternative routes in more safe countries and decided on north east germany (the so called mecklenburgische seenplatte to be precise). i've opted for a route not following any premarket hiking paths and only passing smaller villages (and one bigger town) on my  km stretch, as i've thought staying away from popular tourist spots and big beaches would hopefully help me stay isolated and not having to wear a mask / (i'm still bringing one, but i'd rather enjoy the fresh air within the forests). now i'm just wondering if you guys think my plan would be a good idea, or if i should just stay away from traveling this summer (i'd be hiking in august) all together.
i've opted for mid to late august, since the school holidays will be over in most of germany and hopefully most tourists will already have returned home, but i'm still unsure.
i'll be tent camping the whole route, so i don't have to worry about hotels/hostels not being clean.
any help or suggestions on areas that are safe are highly appreciated."

Lather,hi0blc,0,1593439107,hey guys. i plan to travel to ireland in september for  days. i'll be flying to dublin from england. just wondering if anyone had any itineraries to share? i'd ideally like to get a mixture of city life and nature. i'm happy to stay in multiple different locations.
Lather,hi2c6d,0,1593445866,"hello guys! i'm looking to do some solo travelling in september. i'll be travelling from a london airport. i've narrowed my destination list down to ireland, spain and italy, although **i am open to other suggestions**. **the places i've been to**: new york, germany (hamburg, cologne), copenhagen, netherlands (rotterdam, amsterdam), and greece (athens, meteora). i didn't like athens very much, but meteora was unrelentingly beautiful. even the  hour train journey there was like being on another planet. i'd been very against going to hot countries up until then, but if somewhere can match meteora in beauty, culture and history, i'd go there in a heartbeat. length: around a week, give or take. i hope to travel to at least two different areas with the country i go to.  if it's ireland. budget: fairly tight budget of around £-. i'll be staying in hostels the entire time, and will be cooking most of my own food. i may eat out once or twice. most of the budget will be spent on travel, and maybe a couple of tours. return flights to both italy and spain are roughly £ -  for me, with dublin being around £. climate: nothing over  degrees celsius. luckily i'm travelling in september so spain/italy won't be overbearingly hot, and ireland won't be too cold. interests: culture, history and nature. i'm not the biggest fan of museums, but i do enjoy walking and learning about a place. food isn't super important, as i won't be eating out much. safety: safety is a bit of a concern. it's why i quite like guided tours as you're always with someone knowledgeable, but i won't be able to afford that this time. hopefully you guys have some suggestions for me! like i said, i'm not dead set on going to one of the above  countries, so it's fine if there's another place you'd like to suggest."

* i'm not much of a beach or tropical person. i love mountains so places like oregon, iceland, british columbia, etc. really excite me.
* iceland and new zealand are two countries very high on my list but there's two issues with those. ) i'll be too young to rent a car so i'm worried i won't have as much freedom as i'd like. ) i know those countries are quite expensive so i wouldn't be able to spend as much time there as i would be able to in other countries.
* a road-trip through the u.s ( mainly on the west coast since the only thing that interests me on the east are the cities which with everything going on i'm not sure if that will be viable). this would be good because i've only been to northern cali, tennessee, alabama, and nyc. i would be able to see more of what this country has to offer. i already have a reliable car so my main expense would be gas/food. the only downside to this is that i'm not sure if i would want to do that solo because i don't know how easy it is to meet people with the lack of hostel culture (yes i know couch surfing is sort of prevalent but i'm not sure if that's a good alternative so let me know if you have any experience with that) so the road-trip through the u.s is what i'm leaning towards but the main reasons i'm not sure about that is i wouldn't be able to experience much of other cultures and the other thing i talked about above. any advice would be super helpful, if i didn't give enough info just ask and i'll answer pretty quickly. thanks!"

OurBernard45,gsab35,0,1590686031,"i’ve been meaning to post info that i would’ve appreciated before traveling there solo for a while, but until quarantine always had an excuse to procrastinate. just for context i’m an american male and this was my first time traveling solo. also i spoke enough russian to order food, tell people i don’t speak russian or ukrainian, and read street signs/menus/metro stops. i’m better now and really improved when i was over there. before i get into the details of the trip and what i learned from it, i loved kyiv. the city is amazing with tons to do and really really good food. also coffee is everywhere. also also if you’re considering it there’s a really good youtube channel called visit kyiv that puts out great videos including museums, how to get into town from the airport, and best restaurants for different budgets. i watched all of them and having that foresight was extremely helpful. accomodation i stayed at zig zag hostel which was a real mixed bag. on the one hand, it was super centrally located. just down the block from taras schevchenko park, i could be just about anywhere in the city in  minutes if i took the metro. on the other hand it was not the hostel environment you might picture if you’ve never stayed in one. i chose the  person all male dorm, which was a good pick, and met a few people, but there was no real sense of community. i tried hanging out in the common space to meet people, but that mainly led to chatting with some crazies who were staying there. i helped one of the guys i met move his stuff to the dream hostel, which was less centrally located, but was definitely more young backpackers looking to hang out. getting around i love walking, and think it’s a great way to explore new cities, so i would typically walk places. the metro was great though, and i’d highly recommend taking it to see some of the really cool artwork. every station had a few stalls that accepted tap-and-go credit cards which was super convenient. also just as an aside, the escalators moved way faster than the ones here in the us. food all of the food was incredible. i’m a big fan of eastern european food in general, and the range of cuisines was honestly surprising. puzata hata was a cafeteria-style ukrainian place, and there were several throughout the city. there’s an excellent georgian place near the vauxhall station that wasn’t even on google maps called little georgian cafe. musafir is a crimean place with amazing duck breast. lviv croissant is a bistro chain with amazing breakfast sandwiches. and the last one i’ll plug was o’panas in taras schevchenko park, which is traditional ukrainian with folk music, outfits, and food. coffee is eeeverywhere, and most of it is really good. things that were surprising - the most surprising thing to me was the toilets and lack of toilet paper. obviously something that others may have looked up or assumed, i was not expecting the hole-in-the-ground toilets to be the most easily found. also the lack of available toilet paper, so just prepare accordingly. - parking seemed to be wherever you felt like leaving your vehicle. i saw dozens of range rovers each day parked with one wheel up on the curb. there were also many unmarked, shared sidewalks where cars and people were moving together. so stay aware of your surroundings. - the number of underground shops and the underground mall. most, if not all, major intersections on and near the main stretch (khreschatyk street) have underground passages to cross, and all of these had dozens of little shops, stores, and restaurants or takeaways. most were open pretty late which was super convenient. - i was asked for directions  separate times by locals, or russian/ukrainians. the first morning i was approached by a woman and her  year old son and managed to stammer that i didn't speak ukrainian, which her son openly laughed at. in retrospect it was hilarious, but not a great start. - not kyiv specific but getting used to doing things alone, and being comfortable interacting in a language i barely spoke, was a much larger adjustment than i had anticipated. it initially felt as though everyone else was in on a joke, but i realized after a couple days that i was the only one who was focused on me being foreign. trip details length:  week, all spent in kyiv which was a great amount of time to really get to know the city bag(s): l patagonia blackhole bag with a drawstring backpack for essentials packing list:  pairs of jeans, denim jacket, insulated vest for layering,  long sleeve t-shirts,  short sleeve t-shirts,  shortsleeved button down shirts,  pair of joggers,  pair lightweight boxer briefs,  pair of chukka boots (wouldn’t bring on my next trip, too bulky),  pair canvas tennis shoes,  pair socks phone: bought sim at store near hostel, easy install. went with vodafone, but there were  different options. money: brought some us cash, and had to withdraw a couple times, but most places took credit went on one bar crawl and would highly recommend it, met lots of fun backpackers and tourists and the hosts were great! it was through kyiv pub crawls if you’re interested. hope this helps some of you plan your solo trip!"

bfwolf1,gsg8pu,0,1590704584,"if you canceled a reservation with hostelworld post coronavirus, you've probably been waiting patiently for your refund. today, the ceo sent an email out to those folks giving them the option of taking non-refundable store credit + % or getting a refund potentially as late as april , . this is the behavior of a company that is in financial trouble. i canceled my refundable reservation on april  and they want me to wait more than a year to get my money back? companies in good financial standing don't do that. i filed a dispute with my credit card company, citibank. i was able to do it online and they immediately resolved it in my favor. hostelworld has historically been a pretty good company, and i didn't want to do file a dispute, but them saying they're going to hold on to my money for a year isn't acceptable and makes me think there is a good chance they will go out of business before i got my refund. everybody will have to make their own decisions on this front of course. but for me it was an easy choice."

BogdansBrows,gssryw,0,1590757979,"i've been trying to understand how the solo traveling style will be able to continue in the face of covid. the nature of solo traveling involves the close mingling of people from all around the world in small hostels, often staying in one place for only - days at a time. i had been planning a south america backpacking trip before the coronavirus crisis blew up into a global issue, and have been trying to understand how hostels will operate in the coming months/years. i checked the webpage for selina hostels, a popular chain in south america that has enormous properties with perhaps hundreds and hundreds of beds per location. you can see their page on safety/cleanliness \[here.\]([\_ga=...-.\_gac=...cjwkcajwclbraseiwaenqapigmdpfvhhewjkij\_vgnek-tme-uqd\_dkxpptdnrzhhoczuuqavd\_bwe]()) the highlights:  bed rooms will only accept - people from the same party  bed rooms will only accept  people + bed rooms will run at % capacity and will only accept parties of + people as a true solo traveler, this feels like a dealbreaker. the people you meet in your rooms often become your friends during your stay. and with all of the limits on capacity the hostels will basically be empty and void of the social energy that is so central to the overall experience. do you guys have any hope that we will get hostels back to normal in the next couple of years? or is solo traveling as we knew it dead for the foreseeable future?"
misstheground12,gst2ns,0,1590759125,"i just got back from traveling in india for three and a half months. i'm not going to get into too much detail about the actual trip itself in this post (obviously it got weird with corona), but i did want to write a little thing about tips for traveling light, and travel tips for india specifically. this is aimed at people who haven't solo traveled before. my main thing is to travel as light as possible. these tips assume a generally warm climate, although i did experience temps down in the 's in certain places (feels very cold after 's) and still did fine. obviously this is just the way i tend to travel, every does it their own way, but maybe some newer travelers will find some things here helpful. first off, the advantages of traveling light are pretty obvious. you do a ton of walking while traveling, and it's just less exhausting to have a lighter pack to lug around while you're lost, wandering for miles around the chaotic unmarked streets of bangalore in  degree heat while all the scooters in the city weave around you and blare their illegally amplified horns in unison as they pass by. you also don't have to check any luggage and therefore don't have to worry about your luggage getting lost. you don't have to worry about someone putting your bag up on the roof of the bus where you can't keep an eye on it because you can just keep it in your lap or at your feet. it's also just easier to have fewer things - one bag to keep track of instead of two, and if you're looking for something, it's much easier to find it in a small pack than rifling through something twice as big. my number one tip for traveling light is to limit yourself to a normal (or small) backpack, because you will fill whatever backpack you bring. a small backpack guarantees that you'll only be able to fill that one small backpack, and you'll automatically force yourself to think more carefully about what you absolutely need. when packing, air is your enemy. squish everything down as small as it will go. if you have snacks in bags that are mostly air, fuck that. open them and put the snacks in a ziploc, or user rubber bands to close them again, and get all that goddamn air out. it sounds a little crazy, but small pockets of air add up really quickly. this will happen naturally, but put the things you aren't going to use much in less accessible places, and the things you're using all the time in the most accessible places. i never have debit cards/credit cards in my wallet, only cash. i also put most of the cash i get from the atm back into the backpack, and only carry a little bit at a time. if you really can't fit something into your pack, and you really need to bring it, you can strap it to the outside of the pack. i did this a lot with my nalgene and sometimes with my sweatshirt. for footwear, just bring one pair of sandals if at all possible. shoes take up more room than sandals, and they come with socks, which also take up room, and you have to wash the socks. you may think that's crazy, but small things like socks add up quickly in a small pack and rob you of precious space. on this trip i brought two pairs of shoes (one pair for walking, one for running) as well as a terrible pair of flip flops that cut my feet. i'd suggest you just bring shitty flip flops and buy sandals on day one. then either ditch the flip flops or keep them for showering if you really want them. i bought sandals for  rupees ($) that are still going strong and ditched the flip flops and second pair of shoes. the pair of shoes i hung on to largely lived in the bottom of the pack, just taking up space. the sandals i bought were velcro; i'd say don't buy velcro. go with a gummy or a buckle (like the locals use). the velcro comes undone way too much. bring as few clothes as possible. my wardrobe was one pair of shorts, one pair of pants (jeans), one t-shirt, one long-sleeved t-shirt, a few pairs of socks, a few pairs of underwear, a hooded sweatshirt, winter gloves, and a hat. if you're walking around in a hot climate with nothing to change into, you're going to be sweating balls and will want to wash your clothes fairly often. to wash, you can shower with your clothes on (using soap on your clothes), or just jump in the river, lake, stream, or ocean with your clothes on. in a hot climate, this will help keep you cool, and the clothes will dry very quickly and be sort of clean (won't stink at least). if you don't want to be wearing wet clothes for a little bit, just wash them in the shower with soap, wring them out, and hang them up. also, all your clothing should be light. i brought jeans and thick shorts, and both took up too much room, were heavier, and took way longer to dry because of how thick they were. a sweatshirt is obviously great for warmth if it's a chilly night, but it also can act as a pillow, a towel, and ground cover. after the first few weeks i wasn't using any underwear at all. ditch it. don't choose white for your one t-shirt like i did, unless you want to know exactly how poorly you're cleaning job is. i had brought the hat and gloves because i live in maine and brought them on the way to the airport, but they actually were super nice to have for the ""chilly"" nights when it got down into the 's. i'd often go short sleeves during the day, then long sleeves at night as it gold cooler and the mosquitoes came out. going against the second biggest piece of advice from hitchiker's guide to the galaxy, i didn't bring a towel. in hot climates you dry so quickly, you don't need it. if it's super humid, you're going to be kind of wet all the time anyway. you can also just use your sweatshirt or your long sleeve to dry if you really need to. wiping the water down your body or shaking the water off works pretty well. resealable ziploc bags (with the little slider nub) are amazing for a lot of things. i brought twenty of them stuffed into a little pocket. they can be garbage bags, they can let you easily organize your items while keeping them visible (toiletries, electronics), they can isolate items that might get messy if opened (sun block, hand sanitizer), they can hold snacks that you've opened or leftovers you want to save from the bugs, they can be used to (sort of) water-proof your phone when you go on river excursions with shorts that have shitty pockets. shampoo is just foamy soap. you can just use soap. or don't wash your hair. after a few days it won't even be greasy. bar soap also works fine for washing clothes. just get it sudsy and go to town. you can also easily buy most things there for much cheaper than here, like a power adapter (a few dollars), bar soap ( cents), a toothbrush ( cents), and toothpase ( cents?). tweezers and nail clippers are great for getting splinters out. on travel days, i usually buy a bottle of water to have along with my nalgene. a l of water is cheap, but very awkward to transport because of how big it is. better to just get the l. tape is helpful to have. among a million other things, i used it to make new backpack zipper handles when mine started to break. duct tape is my go-to, but it turns out it's not good for fixing mosquito net holes. medical tape was way better. i used the reading light a lot, as well as the flash light. it's good to have alternatives to your phone in a case it's dead. tweezers and nail clippers are very helpful for getting splinters out or sharpening your pencil with the nail filer if your cheap pens shit out on you and you're in the jungle. i used bandaids a lot after scratching mosquito bites until they bled. i didn't use the ear plugs, but probably should have. i definitely didn't need a whole package of them. also didn't really use the bug lotion, but should have. did use the antibiotics in varanasi and was glad to have them. used a lot of sun block, and have been told it's hard to get in india but i didn't notice if it was/wasn't. a frisbee is a great way to meet locals and takes up very little space in your pack. it's especially good if you can do really simple tricks with it on your own while you wait for a partner. when someone walks by, just gesture at them and show them how to catch it with two hands. if they seem halfway eager, throw them a toss. i had amazing sessions with people you would never expect to be interested - a  year old villager tossed with me for  minutes, the first half with a machete in his other hand, which made me very nervous. some items i could have used: i brought a book instead of a kindle because my trip was kind of impromptu. obviously a kindle is going to take up way less space and hold many more books. i did start reading ebooks on my phone, so there's that, but it strains your eyes more than a kindle would and drains the phone battery. my reading light died, and i didn't have any replacement flat batteries. i could have used a small cloth bag for a day pack. it would have been super cheap to just buy one there, but i never did. i made an awkward day pack out of a ziploc bag and duct tape, but it was pretty ugly. i went with schwab for my debit card, and venture capital one for my credit card. schwab was great - they reimburse atm fees. i did seem to struggle, like many people, to get money from bank of india atm's. venture was absolute garbage for me. they blocked the majority of my transactions as fraud, even though i expressly told them i would be traveling in india. when i reached them by phone, they wanted me to verify my identity by sending an sms to my us number, which was impossible because i was in india with the indian sim card. unlike every other company ever, they were completely unwilling to verify by email. they finally let me verify by taking a picture of my driver's license, weird, but glad it worked out. anyway, sometimes even when i was on the phone with them while trying to make a purchase from the jungle when the holy trinity of having power and internet service and a short hold time all miraculously converged, they would be unable to stop the purchase from being blocked, telling me that ""that's how our fraud prevention system works"". terrible. psychological stuff: i guess this doesn't apply to solo travel, but if you're thinking about traveling with someone you haven't traveled with long-term before - try going on a weekend trip with them somewhere to see how they travel, how they plan, how they handle unexpected issues. i briefly traveled with a guy who hated making plans and would just change everything at the last minute and you had to follow his lead or he would just ditch was fucking tiring for me, but maybe for someone else that's perfect. accept when plans change or don't work out. it will happen. wherever you go it's most likely crazy and different than your home country anyway, even if it's just the train station floor where you'll be sleeping that night because the city took over all the hotels that day to use for quarantining suspected coronavirus cases. india specific: a smartphone is essential and baked into normal indian daily life. buy train tickets (irctc), figure out how many hours late your train is running (rail yatri / where is my train), get taxis/rickshaws (ola/uber), find trails (maps me), make sure your phone can handle g in india (many american phones can't, because it's a different wireless band or something). mine was comptable with india, but only g, so i had terrible slow internet the whole time, so check that, too. there are many articles talking about getting an indian number. it's dumb and annoying but worth it. even most free wifi in india requires you being able to receive an sms code, so you can't get the free wifi without an indian phone number. something i was unaware of is that india will turn your sim card off after  months, saying that it's because your visa is expiring, even if you're on a longer visa. so just be ready for that if you're staying longer. i got a text that my plan was expiring, added  more months to it, then a day later got a text saying they were shutting the sim down because of my visa. luckily the plans are cheap as hell (like $ for  months), but still. fuck you vodafone. to buy train tickets online, you need an account through irctc, which seems to have been created by a drunk twelve year old. it is possible to get an account and to actually buy tickets with an american credit card. i believe there are sites dedicated to explaining this. one weird thing i noticed is that when you're registering your account, when it just says ""country"" it means the country of the phone number you're using, so put ""india"". otherwise you get an error and it doesn't tell you why it isn't working. when you go to pay for a ticket there are  different options for rd party payment processing. sometimes one will work and sometimes it won't. i literally got an error that said ""some error has occurred"". this shit is also constantly changing, so get someone to help you if at all possible. the cheapest places to stay are not online, but it's good to have a few backups in mind if you can't find a cheap place for whatever reason. for example - in gokarna there are a string of places right on the beach that are r ($.) a night for a private room, much cheaper than the dorms in hostels that are listed online. people speak english, but it might be so accented that you struggle to understand, and they also struggle to understand you. it's basically a creole, and if you don't speak it with the right accent, they have no idea what you're saying. i kept saying btm layout - ""bee tee em layout"" and no one understood me. finally i pointed to a sign, and they said, ""oooh. beedeem!"" always, always ask if you're unsure. ask multiple people, try to get a consensus. do not trust one person's answer. indians love to seem helpful, even if they have no fucking clue. do not trust google maps in india. it was wrong so many times. like the thing is on the other side of a really crazy busy street, or not there at all. i walked about a mile in pretty hot weather to an atm on google maps, and when i got there it was clear there hadn't even been a building there for ten years. don't do holi in varanasi, or probably any city, especially if you're a woman. it's just a hassle at best and dangerous at worst. i got my balls grabbed from behind by a dude on a scooter. the women with us got aggressively and repeatedly hugged and had to slap a lot of drunk indians. on very full trains, general class spills into sleeper class. if you're not assertive you might be sharing your bed with other people, and there will be literally no floor space because it will be full of bodies and you'll have to basically rock climb over them to get to the bathroom. don't eat cold street food in varanasi (or any street food). everyone i met in varanasi had been eating street food all over india, and convinced me to eat it in varanasi, and then all of us got sick. very shitty. i took pictures of what i came back with. as you can see, i added things that took up more room, and still had space in the pack. i'll put captions on the pictures, but briefly it was clothes, nalgene, shoes, sandals, toiletries, tape, reading light, charger, adapter, bug spray, notebooks, bamboo water bottle souvenir, indian print dress souvenir, camera, snacks, souvenir honey split into  bottles for tsa regulations, ziploc bags, compass, flashlight, wallet, mp player, glasses case, pens, book, link to packing images: "

helpwitheating,gtq9fg,0,1590888999,"one of my relatives isn't doing well and i am trying to go see them in the fall. unfortunately, this trip would involve flying. not ideal during a pandemic. i have some savings and was thinking about trying to go first class. the tickets seemed so cheap and the seats are farther apart. i saw all of the photos of economy class jammed packed and no one enforcing mask rules, so no seat is safe, but these ones seemed just a tiny bit safer. most air filtration systems on planes go from front to back, so according to some articles i read, sitting closer to the front is safer. i booked a flight and on it no seats in first class were coming up as taken. i would be at least six feet away from other people. it seemed like the safest possibly option. a week later, i got an email that the flight information had been updated. it was now a much smaller plane doing the flight. still, my seat was in first class (bigger seats further apart) and it looked empty. yesterday i got another email. the flight information had been updated again. now, the flight will happen on a tiny plane that is showing almost all the seats as full. there are no cabins and the seats are all the same distance apart. also, it was now in two legs with a transfer through a very busy airport. i feel unsafe going into an airport to begin with. this one is frequented by american travellers. i cancelled for now and was able to get a refund. i find this annoying, given that the airline i chose just got a massive government bailout and fuel is cheaper than ever. packing people in during a pandemic doesn't seem fair. flying is unsafe right now period, but flying on a full, tiny, old plane seems especially dangerous. so i'm not going for now, unless something changes. i wished countries actually enforced their new regulations on planes so that it was safe to fly. i've also just heard horror stories from a friend who had to fly home recently. the person sitting next to her took off his mask and coughed quite frequently. the airplane staff did nothing, and the flight was full, so there was nowhere she could go. that in combination with the new tiny plane has scared me off flying until there's a vaccine. it may be possible for me to take a train out to see my family member in my own cabin with a window that opens. it would just take about seven days, so that's not ideal either. still looking into different options."

- had more than enough money to travel for ish years - had only one shot to go proper nomadic in your life before you settle down with family , job etc
- no real rush to leave (apart from boredom) as i don’t have a graduate job lined up would you still travel this year? i’m just worried that if i go as soon as bans are lifted, i won’t be making the most of my ‘one shot’ before settling down. places will be quiet and people will be nervous in the post corona wake. i was thinking of just chilling here at home, doing a few part time jobs to keep me busy , then waiting til next year ? on one hand i don’t want this experience to be tainted in the post corona wake... on the other hand, it seems a waste to wait another year when i could leave tomorrow (money wise)!!? what would you guys do? i originally had all of asia in mind. but possibly was thinking i could go to a ‘western’ country like australia to work for a bit later this year until asia gets back to normal. cheers"

rakahr11,gaib3n,0,1588196168,"hello everyone! i decided to start a storytime series, with a weekly topic and of course i will start out with one of my gems i got during my travels. shortly, some small key things about me: i (m) started traveling on my own when i was  and since then i was on every continent of the world but africa and antarctica. i am missing a lot of countries though, so luckily, i haven't been ""everywhere"" yet. my longest breakless travel was for a bit more than a year exploring south, southeast asia, ozeania and oz. i always travelled alone and teamed up with fellow travelers along the way. my luggage was never bigger than handluggage (- kg) and was just a regular over the shoulder day bag. feel free to ask me any questions or dm me if you like! so here i go with this weeks story: i was traveling in south india, kerala at that time and met a person along the way. i met jonathan desperately looking for a place to sleep, while i was outside having a cigarette and battling my sick stomach. we were able to convince the night guard to bring us a second matress and that jonathan can stay in my single room. along the way up from trivandrum we passed by varkala, parajakadavu and wanted to stay in kottayam to do a back water tour and go to munnar later for some tea plantation sightseeing and cooler temperatures. we arrived in kottayam around  pm. it was january, so the sun goes down pretty early. the whole city had a very weird vipe and there were only  hotels, which were fully booked and basically no accomodation other than those hotels. the lonely planet was no help, and so we went asking if there is a place where we could stay the night. after an hour or two, it was already pitch dark and we got more and more scared to walk around in the dark, we found a place that seemed to offer a bed. i asked the guy at the frontdoor: ""are you full?"" he said: ""no! no i am not fool"". me:""oh great, your are not full"", he:""no, no i am full!"", me: ""but you said your aren't full, so are you full?"", he: ""no i am no fool!"" i was pretty confused. he started to shout at me in malayalam with some english bits and throw us on the streets. a guy appeared next to us and asked: ""why you calling him a fool?"" i understood my mistake, or rather that i haven't pronounced the word correctly enough. since then, i always ask for ""room free"" rather than ""full"". haha. #xb; so what are some stories of yours? happy to read them!"

Ilikegammon,gb0jzf,0,1588269036,"hey i'd like some help trying to choose my next destination(s) once covid ends. i'm a solo backpacker who's done a fair amount of travelling. ive spent  months travelling thailand, cambodia, vietnam, laos, and malaysia. i then took another trip to sea to spend  weeks in the philippines. i also spent  weeks cycling (bike touring/living in a tent) in croatia, bosnia, montenegro, albania and macedonia. i'm trying to choose between a trip to: option : sri lanka option : colombia and either nicaragua or peru (ill chose between either nic or peru if i decide option  is the one i want). i'm flexible when i can travel and i'm also flexible for how long i can travel for but it'll likely be about a month. one thing i love about travel is broadening my horizons, seeing new things, new ways of life. for that reason i was considering central/south america as i've not explored that are yet. but then one place i feel i've missed during my sea trips is sri lanka. i'll describe my interests below to help choose: i like real true adventures. i like the outdoors and really like a proper exploration. i'm very fit and healthy and i like challenges too (hence the  week cycle ride consisting of km rides every day). i like getting out into nature and don't mind roughing it. especially doing all of this with good company from others. it's the sense of adrenaline i crave which helps make life long memories. i like being out of my comfort zone. all of this betters me and gives me a sense of achievement. affordable when factoring everything in... flights from london, travel when i'm there etc. i travel budget. i like to swim in natural environments (the sea of lakes) when it's safe to do so (i won't get eaten by a crocodile or shark!). this doesn't mean i need to swim for all of my trip but it's nice to do at least a few times. i'm a  year old single male so i would like to meet new people especially other solo travellers (and maybe a solo female traveller). i love a good social hostel. i appreciate both options i listed are hot countries but i'd enjoy it if i wasn't sweating every minute of my trip!"
ripponguy,gb0l50,0,1588269132,"
*this is a very long post so sorry for the length of it! so i’m planning a big trip for summer . i was thinking june - october. i am a solo traveller, a  year old guy who is not extravagant. it will essentially be a somewhat comfortable backpacking trip. so far i have accumulated about $, cad (canadian currency) in my savings account for this trip. i was originally planning to go to europe for a month or so in july/aug. but as this pandemic has unfolded it is obviously likely not possible at all to travel this summer or anytime soon... so this is giving me more time to save. i am still working so that is good, and i make pretty okay money. i’m able to put away around $ each paycheck that i get. sometimes a bit more, sometimes a little bit less. i will have one more full year to save now, and expect that i can save around an additional $,-$, cad between now and next may/june, just depending on how frugal/money smart i am going to be. at the very minimum i can save another ,-, cad for sure. anyways, my question is - probably for those who have spent a lot of extended periods of time abroad... how much money will i really need? i have no purchased flights, accommodation or anything as of yet. just saving. so this expected -k cad will be for everything. spending money? i am planning on going for  months, like i said, to europe and middle east/africa. some of the countries i plan to hit are very expensive, and some are much cheaper. i plan to go to iceland, scotland, ireland, england, france, italy, spain, croatia, germany, austria, poland, netherlands, sweden, denmark, belgium, hungary, czechia, turkey, israel, jordan (petra), egypt (if safe), zimbabwe (guided tour of victoria falls and such), and morocco. as you can see this is a very ambitious and lengthy/ packed trip. it’s going to expensive. and basically i just want to know if you all think i’m being realistic with the amount of money i plan to have saved and the number of countries i plan to visit. am i being realistic or naive? it will be for  months as i really don’t want to rush my way through all the countries and i really wanna explore and take it all in. some places i prefer to spend a much longer time in (i plan to stay in london for - days, ireland- days) and some i want to only spend / or  days in (austria, czechia, hungary etc) i realize that some of the more expensive western countries are the ones i want to spend longer in... and this could be problematic. i also will be staying in hostels, not hotels, and i will be able to stay for free with a friend for a big portion of my time in england. i am not a shopper at all, as in clothing or commodities, so i will be spending very little on merchandise or goods, if anything at all. but i do like to go out a lot and party / explore nightlife. food is going to be a major expense, obviously, but as i’ve travelled alone before, some days i’m really good at just getting by on a cheap sandwich and some chips and fruit and the like. i’m not going to be going out for many extravagant meals, but i will be wanting to experience the odd upper-tier cuisine restaurants and try out some good food. as for other expenses - i hope to go on a few guided tours. and train mostly between the countries where i can. so i’m expecting some kind of rail pass might be accessible to me. i’m also not forgetting about travel health insurance and expenses like this. so basically, can some one who has done what i am planning enlighten me and give me any advice, tips, insight and info on my plans? should i be condensing my trip? is it do-able? am i crazy? if the money is not enough, how much *would* i need to make this trip a reality? i think k - k is a lot of money... but i would probably even wait another additional year to save more if it weren’t do - able and make it ? as i really want to hit all these places on my list, and truly embark on the trip of a lifetime. so please any help would be greatly appreciated! thank you!"

TheFoolsWhoDream,gb6so8,0,1588288905,"so i posted this on r/unpopularopinions and a lot of people seemed to disagree with me and obviously i'm sure everyone on here will agree, but i just wanted to make sure what i'm saying makes sense. this is probably going to sound very pretentious, but i know and see so many people who claim to love traveling, but they always stay in the most expensive hotels, eat at the most expensive restaurants, and don't actually immerse themselves in the culture of wherever they are and it makes me so angry. these people don't like traveling, they like going on vacation. usually i see this from rich / wealthy people and it's very common among social media influencers. i don't want to police what anyone does and take away from what people enjoy doing, but travel is all about really immersing yourself in the culture, learning some of the local language, meeting local people, and trying new experiences. it's staying in a hostel for $ a night with people from all over the world, renting an apartment on airbnb from a local couple, and getting lost wandering the streets. it's coming away having learned more about the history and people of where you are and coming away with a new perspective on the world. i don't understand how staying in a copy and paste hotel that costs $, a night equates to a new experience, whereas if you stay in someone's apartment and get to know a little bit about what it's like to truly live where you are. as someone who doesn't have the money to travel freely, but really enjoys learning languages and exploring new places, it is so infuriating to see rich people waste their time ""traveling"" all over the world when the things they're doing could be done in any city in the world and claiming. i don't know if this is actually unpopular or not, but i thought i'd share. traveling and going on vacation are not the same. i think a lot of people took this is me saying that traveling isn't going to a new place and they didn't understand that i actually just meant that the word ""travel"" means a whole lot more to a whole lot of people and not all travel is the same."
Crazypanda8,gbb9ok,0,1588306098,"okay, so i'm  right now, and when i'm  i would like to go to bruges. i'm from england so it would be a easy trip (i have yet to get round to cost and money xd). a train ride to hull, then the overnight ferry from hull to zeebrugge. spend the night at a hotel in bruges, then get the ferry home the next day. a pointless small trip, but its somewhere i have always wanted to go and i know i could do it when i'm . when thinking about this originally i was not phased by the idea of being alone. i'm rather independent and i know i would be fine (i don't have anyone who would go with me anyway, so its not really an option ). but, as of recent thinking, i'm seeing the logical dangers of a  year old female travelling alone to such a foreign place. should i be worried? i feel like i would be safe, but that doesn't stop worry.  please give me a little advice. i'm not really sure what i'm asking here lol, i just would like some other opinions on this idea. i get its a little crazy, but i know it would be so much fun."

ea0995,fra94q,0,1585505306,"hi all, does anybody have anything they wished they had done or had done better in a solo travel trip? i have done two solo travel trips in my life. the first was to la and i made it because the few people who could go were pretty flaky when it came to purchasing everything, so i went solo. im not the most outgoing person but i did meet a few people. i do wish i had done a better effort in meeting people and going out more in the nighttime. i was raised to always watch your back and avoid putting yourself in dangerous situations so i think that was part of the reason i didnt go out as much. the second was to san diego, and i dont know if it should be considered a solo trip because i went for a friend's wedding but i went for a week and was solo for most of it, so to me its a solo trip. i did a better job of meeting people and going out but i still feel like i could've done a better job at going out and meeting people. i would prefer my next trip be with people but i am not opposed to solo traveling again if i ever had to. i'm not waiting for other people to get interested in travelling for me to travel."
ilovejoe143,frdebb,0,1585516225,"hi all, i was originally planning a trip for this year to go to poland, vienna, and prague. i didn’t have a specific date in mind but i was thinking late spring/ early summer or early fall. i have unfortunately come to terms with the fact that i probably will not be able to do this trip. it is, in fact, due to the covid . to explain a little further, i am living in the us currently (green card) and have a canadian passport. my passport is expiring in august and i have been meaning to renew it very soon. i was planning on getting my passport photos done a few weeks ago but covid  has shut everything down. canadian passport photo requirements are very strict so i cannot just go to a drug store, which are open, and get my photo taken, i have to go to an actual photographer, which are all closed. years ago, i did get my renewal sent back with a drugstore photo so they do not mess around. i do not want to risk getting my renewal form sent back again. so this really limits what i can do. i really have only a few options: ) attempt to renew my passport as quickly as possibly once things start to get better and get to a photographer. i am estimating i can get to a photographer in a early summer, mid summer if things are not good. this would mean a trip with little planning after i get my passport, around late summer, early fall i hope. i am a big planner with trips, so this trip would have to stay on the simpler side, otherwise i will get anxious lol ) stay domestically. this isn’t ideal as i have seen a lot of the us, and i am not very intrigued by many places in the us to travel to solo. ) go somewhere in the winter. i am thinking by winter time, the covid- issue will be much more under control and travel should be good. i should also have my passport by then. thinking this could be a ski trip as i am an avid skier anyone have any ideas that would fit in one of the above categories? the trip would be max about  days including travel. budget is not too much of an issue, but i do like to travel a bit more on the budget side. places i have been: london, paris, amsterdam, budapest, zurich, spain, brussels, canada, and many places in the us (too many to list). sorry for the long post!!! any ideas or thoughts or discussion are welcome :) i am just itching to travel!!"

SoloTravelerWorld,frsood,0,1585581573,"*i'm writing about my experience of travel and covid- over the last three days of my trip to morocco, from the point of hearing that “we should leave now” to actually getting onto my flight home.* though i am currently in morocco with a bit of uncertainty about flights home, the pain i feel during this crisis is for the hotel workers, the vendors in the medina, the tour guides and coach drivers, the restaurant workers and all who are being affected by the lack of tourists. for everyone in tourism, from the women weaving carpets in the atlas mountains (whose carpets won't sell this year, leaving a surplus in the market and making income next year precarious as well), to the employees of the tour companies with whom you book your trips, my heart aches. many of us will be affected financially due to the virus, but those working in tourism will feel it first. and, while many in north america and europe have some sort of financial cushion, savings or access to loans from family, financial institutions or potentially government, that will not be the case for many workers in morocco and elsewhere, whose very survival depends on tourists. to give you a sense of the situation, in this hotel of  rooms, the  in our group represents more than half of the people staying in the hotel. it's difficult to reconcile what we see in the markets of marrakesh with what we see and hear from home. images on the news and social media don't connect with my experience here, where the markets are stocked and ready for an influx of tourists. from trinkets to, yes, toilet paper, the shelves of shops in the medina are full. though yesterday, at the carrefour, it was clear that panic-buying has begun to happen here as well. to see reports of travel and covid- on the news, looking at the pandemic from a global scale, with panic buying and images of thousands of passengers in airports trying to get home, it can look quite terrible. from my individual experience, it is not so, at least not so far. ## how to get home was the big question most of the time spent getting home has been waiting to find out how we'll get home. fortunately, marco and the staff at just you were taking care of this. the confusion started on saturday. our original flights were to leave tuesday but there were reports that the moroccan government would be closing their airspace by monday night. the scramble began. we basically kept our bags packed and ready to go on a moment's notice from then on. sunday, we thought we could be going. early morning we found that we weren't and were able to squeeze in one more excursion. we went to essaouira, a lovely seaside town a few hours from marrakesh. we were all happy to be going somewhere to get our minds off the turmoil and enjoy travel. i actually bought a painting. monday morning we went to breakfast looking for information as to whether we'd get out that afternoon or not. it took until noon to find out that it wasn't possible but, through some magic, morocco agreed to keep planes flying on the th and we would leave the next day on our originally scheduled flights. however, not everyone was flying with just you. two women had made their own flight arrangements and had to confirm whether theirs were still going. fortunately, they had a family member at home who was their travel agent. all went well for them. another woman had had plans to move on to portugal after our trip. as the canadian government's advice changed day by day, her plans changed as well. just you was very helpful in finding her a route home. though we left marrakesh on different planes, we both had a transfer and one night stay at london gatwick. i already had a room booked so i offered to share. yes, we were somewhat stuck the last few days of the trip, with lots of uncertainty, but we were in a nice hotel. efforts were being made to ensure that we could leave and get home. once at the airport, we met many people whose return flights were much later than the th. for them, standby was the only solution. ## travel and covid-: at the airport tuesday morning, i awoke to an email from my husband and yet another article saying that morocco was closing air travel to and from the uk at : that night. my faith lay with the embassies. i was sure they would have negotiated a means for repatriating their citizens. after all, what does morocco want with us? we left for the airport at : am for a : pm flight. we didn't know what we would be in for and all agreed, better to sit there and have time to deal with whatever was ahead of us than stay too long at the hotel. when we arrived, the confusion made it difficult to determine what line to get in. there was no one to ask. i went to the front of the line and the men there had been waiting since : am. they didn't have tickets! i asked others as i walked back to my group and discovered some had tickets and some were there on a wish and a prayer. we waited there two hours when, finally, a representative came to declare the line we were in to be for standby travelers and another for those with confirmed tickets. we were in the wrong line. ah well, there was a great shuffle and all got sorted. while in line i met two women whose tour was cut short by about eight days. on their way to the atlas mountains they turned back and were put up for a night in marrakesh. the next day they were left to sort their way home to new zealand on their own despite having booked their flights through a different tour company. their confirmed tickets were not for another week and, of course, they had to get out much sooner than that. i have to say, hearing this story confirmed that the care taken of us by just you was really exceptional. ## we're on board the aircraft once through check-in, security, and additional security at the gate, we boarded the aircraft only to wait some more. for some reason, we were not getting permission to take off despite there being very few planes at the airport. an hour and a quarter in, they announced that they would begin to serve refreshments. but, as we were in morocco, there would be no alcoholic drinks. you can imagine the sighs and laughs at this announcement. people were happy, even a little giddy, as we seemed to be on our way. these little inconveniences were more a source of humor than anything. two and a half hours after our scheduled departure, we got on our way. to great applause we landed at gatwick another three hours later. collecting our bags was easy as there was only one conveyor operating in the baggage claim area. i expect that tomorrow's flight home via air transat will be easy with a fairly empty terminal but i'll get there early just in case. if anything special happens, i'll add it to this post. i will be very glad to be home! but then, there's two weeks of self-isolation. ah well, i can use the time to write and dream of future travel. i'd like to thank [just you]() for sponsoring this trip to morocco. please be assured the opinions are all my own. ## an update from home leg two of my trip home was from london gatwick airport to toronto. i flew air transat, an airline that is often less expensive and one that i like for a number of reasons. we boarded and on each seat was a plastic bag holding a sandwich, small pringles, bottle of water and a sweet for dessert. the senior flight attendant came on the speaker to announce that this was a repatriation flight and would not, therefore have regular service. as she went on her voice cracked, i teared up and when i looked at the two women beside i saw that they had as well. upon arrival there were claps and cheers. home is an emotion as much as it is a place. check out this and other articles at []()"

oskalu,fsb2ij,0,1585653082,"hi
first off i want to say that im a rookie with hiking and everything around it. i have thought about doing a hike through some of the national parks in the us for a while.
some parks i have on my list is: grand canyon, yosemite, yellowstone, death valley, seguaro national park, big sur, redwood - sequoia nation park, umpqua national park, klamath national park, rocky mountain national park, great sand dunes national park. so my questions:
. is it possible to hike through california(start: sequoia np) to portland (big sur or somewhere close)? . if i would like to hike through all these parks what would be the best way to organize it? . i have never done a ”serious” big hike before, what would be your best tips? . is it preferable to hike solo or with someone else, what is your oppinion? . (optional) is there any more parks that is worth making a hike through in the states?"
elevenkgod,fscwfi,0,1585661282,"i know there are exceptions and you can't fully generalize and it really depends on the person you are (what you like, want, need etc) and country. but for me the best stories and experiences i had where when i really had to take care of my budget and tried to spend as less i possibly could. examples: you can't afford or don't want to pay for a certain tour so you try to get there yourself and you have to get in touch with locals to ask. you don't want to pay to get from a to b for a tourist bus/ flight so you have to hitchhike/ take  different local busses/ ferrys/ fisher boats/ etc.
you can't afford or don't want to pay for normal accomodation, so you couch surf or ask locals for cheap ""fucked up"" hotels at non touristy spots you wouldn't have seen otherwise etc.
there are many more examples! in my opinion it really depends on you but if you want an authentic/ adventourus travelexperience you should try to do everything you can and want on a budget. cause then you have to interact more with locals and strangers (hitchhike/ couch surf/ asking people on the streets) i know it sounds cliché but the best things that happened to me where things i couldn't buy (even if i wanted to), like getting invited by locals for dinner/ fiestas/ overnight stay/ fishing trips etc. also for me it feels different if i do a tour x with an agency, pay for it and get everything instantly or if i try to do the same tour x by myself or friend or with a help of a local guide. like in general just the feeling of authenticity when you walk and explore something on your own vs doing the same thing but having to pay for it (it almost feels like that when money is involved it can destroy the feeling of authenticity or whatever word i'm searching for right now)
+ being on a budget forces you to be creative which is fun and you might feel proud of yourself to master a certain ""challenge"". + you learn a lot more about a culture cause you are literally living it when you use the same transport, sleep in their houses, eat the same food do the same stuff etc. also my experience (attention: very subjective opinion): most of the time, when i choose to sleep in hostels, i compare the hostels on different aspects first but one of the most important aspects to me is the price but it's not just the price itself! i found most of the time people in cheaper hostels are more likely to be longtime solotraveler like me and are often more fun and social compared to people staying in fancy hostels. of course they can be fun and they def are but the interests are more often different then mine (example drinking/ partying) and in my experience they were less ""crazy and unique personalities"" (which i personally love to meet) or open to new uncommon experiences. a reason for that could be that people in the more expensive accommodations have more money are more likely on vacation etc. ps: i had totally different trips and different experiences. with and without a lot of money. and i don't have to be that short on a budget but for me it's just more fun and interesting (and of course, the cheaper, the more/ longer trips i can do). but still i prefer my trips where i tried to be on a budget."
indthwy,fsece6,0,1585666641,"because i see way way more complaints about india being more hassle-y, dangerous, tourist-unfriendly than just about any other country in the world. not just here, but on many other online travel forums. lost count of how many times i have come across comments saying stuff like ""i have been to insert large number of countries, and india is by far the worst place i have ever been to"". sometimes it seems like they are saying that traveling alone in india is less enjoyable than traveling in a war zone. is it genuinely the case that most people who end up going to india solo tend to dislike it? do users here truly find india to be several orders of magnitude more stressful, dangerous, unfriendly, etc than other countries in asia, middle east, africa, europe, or the americas? or is it just that those who had a bad experience tend to be louder?"
rakuu,fsiqn5,0,1585680669,"i see this so often among young people (-) and ""digital nomads"" in the hostel scene. i've run into conversations with young people talking to each other about their family's yachts, going on safaris, staying at fancy expensive island resorts, having different family houses, paying with their family's credit cards, or calling up their family for another bank transfer. they almost always hush or change the conversation when i get close or say hi. it just really seems like they only talk about it amongst themselves. i'm guessing it's rich people culture, where they don't talk about it with people who don't have money. this really fascinated me and i started steering convos (naturally and friendly!) into leading questions. have you been on a yacht, been to africa, favorite beach, what kind of high school did you go to? etc. with some followups of course. almost always with younger people i'd find out they went to prep/boarding schools, went to resorts growing up with their families, etc. staying in hostels seems like a weird rite of passage for young rich people, like living in messy sororities or frats, sharing tiny apartments in brooklyn, etc. then once they get to their mid-'s i never see them anymore and it's all teachers on break, older people who never got to travel before, people taking a trip of a lifetime, etc. i'm guessing the young people from loaded families move up to staying in boutique hotels and going to fancy/michelin restaurants once they get a little older. is this on point? it seems like a big thing that just isn't talked about, especially in european/western culture. anyone want to share experiences about this?"

Jayhcee,faq75c,0,1582869799,"this could be anything from the flight tickets, to the hostels, to getting around, - just them little things you do to make life easier or to get a little advantage. for me, when i'm planning a trip i normally go on g-adventures and see what routes they have for their tours in that country or even the region. i'm not one to ever go on the tour, but it gives a really idea of sense of direction and any places i might be missing. wikitravel/voyage for reading up on destinations. i \*always\* scout my hostels on hostelworld simply for the ""atmosphere"" indicator. no one else has this, and the hw rating is the best imo. then i will book on agoda. for some reason - in se asia at least - the agoda price is normally £ or £ cheaper than what you'll see on hw or booking... and even be offered on the desk in person! i've yet to figure why. of late one thing i do when arriving to a country to see if someone has blogged an ""arriving to x airport"" thing on youtube. take bangkok, a few people have uploaded videos showing the best places to exchange money, where you go to get the train, and i feel like it just really helps walking out of customs and being somewhat familiar with what it all looks like and the general direction you're heading. there is a few of the top of my head!"

CamboMakgeolliMan,faqn6h,0,1582872265,"don't mention the c-word in the travel industry (a short piece to share with colleagues in the travel industry) coronavirus, or the exotically named covid-, is the new c-word, at least in the world of travel and tourism. media and social media hype are combining to create a crisis in the industry that will have repercussions long after the immediate hysteria subsides. the effects are about so much more than tourism statistics, they are about real people, real lives, real jobs and real struggles. every cancelled trip adds up to a climate of fear and uncertainty within the travel industry and companies begin to tighten the purse-strings. it has an impact all the way down the food chain as overseas tour operators cancel holidays, airlines ground flights and local dmcs cancel itineraries. this in turn means hotel cancellations, tour guide cancellations, vehicle cancellations, restaurant cancellations, excursion cancellations and so it goes on. this can have a negative impact on morale in a brittle industry in a less-developed country where the margins between progress and poverty are wafer thin. it can also have a disastrous impact on income for those many millions of individuals involved in making a living in this industry. let's pause and reflect for a moment on what has happened to date, according to world health organisation (who) statistics. around , people have been infected globally to date, although the numbers are still spiking in some countries, and about  people have died. this is undoubtedly a terrible hardship to endure for those most immediately affected, but it might be useful to put this in the perspective of some other statistics: • , to , flu deaths occur annually according to older who statistics, some put the numbers at closer to ,-, annually • , people have been hospitalised in the usa with flu this winter alone (and it's not over) with about , deaths • ,, traffic-accident related deaths occur worldwide per year according to the who •  million cases of malaria were diagnosed in , of which , proved fatal, according to the who • , murders took place worldwide in  this information is not shared to appear fatalistic or pessimistic, but to help rediscover our sense of perspective in these dark times. flu happens every year in every corner of the world and all-too tragically kills an awful lot of people, but we still go about our daily lives and continue to travel the world. traffic accidents are a clear and present danger to our lives, but we still need to drive from a to b as part of our daily lives. malaria has been a constant in many parts of the world for too many years to remember, but locals are forced to live with its threat (despite the availability of affordable treatments) and many visitors continue to travel to countries where malaria exists. murders are a horrible reality in almost every country of the world, often quite random in nature, and the total number is beyond comprehension. however, once again, we continue to explore and experience other cultures and other places. so let us put the c-word in its context among a myriad of other problems that face many people in many parts of the world as they go about their daily lives. let's not make the small medical crisis of a new flu strain become a socio-economic and political crisis that tips the world into a global recession and devastates not just the tourism industry, but every other industry on this planet. the human cost will be too great to bear and undo a generation of progress in many parts of the developing world."

opotatomypotato,fauum6,0,1582897198,"i’ve had obsessive-compulsive disorder since i was . while it’s gotten (much) better over the years, i still deal with it every day and will for the rest of my life. i have depression as well (goes hand-in-hand with ocd), so as you can imagine i’m a ball of anxiety, dread, and self-doubt. i also love to solo travel. it has been difficult (and so ridiculous it borders on amusing at times), so i wanted to share some of my experiences with the /ocd, /depression, and /solotravel communities to a) share some funny stories, and b) to show that it’s possible to still \~do\~ things even if you’re mentally ill. so, read on and learn some of the dos-and-donts of travelling with mental illness! #xb; incident number : rabies scare (first sequence) when i was in petra, a kitten jumped on my lap and i almost-maybe-possibly-can’t-be-sure think i felt his claws on my leg through my pants. didn’t think anything of it until a week later when i was in turkey and decided that i had definitely contracted rabies and i was stupid for not realising this sooner. proceeded to have a slight breakdown, ask everyone in my dorm if they thought i should go to the hospital (“no? it didn’t break skin?”), post on reddit, cry, and google which hospital i should go to the next day. went to hospital no. , couldn’t find anyone at reception to help me. tried to catch a taxi to hospital no. , couldn’t find one. went back to my hotel and called my parents so they could reassure me that, no, i didn’t have rabies and no, i didn’t need to go to the hospital. still couldn’t deal so i messaged my nurse friend to ask her if i was being stupid. her response? “yes, you’re being stupid.” decided i was okay and tried to have a good time. #xb; incident number : rabies scare (second sequence) are you sensing a theme here? my ocd has always been very health-focused, so the fixation on rabies doesn’t surprise me. i had (mostly) put the first rabies incident out of my mind. about three weeks after my initial freak-out, i was in kotor and having a great time playing bullshit in the hostel common-room. the hostel was in the old town, so the common room was separate from the hostel and opened out onto the street. there were a few cats hanging around but i didn’t want a repeat of last time so i (tried) to be careful. however, as i was soon to learn, cats like me – a funny-looking ginger dude decided to make a beeline towards me, weave through  other people and jump straight into my lap. i humoured him a little but when he started doing that thing they do with their claws on my leg i decided enough was enough and he had to go (because i reeeeealllllyyyyy didn’t want another rabies “scare”). ginger kitty didn’t like me trying to move him though, and in protest he. grabbed. my. thumb. with. his. teeth. understandably i freaked the fuck out, couldn’t believe this was happening again, asked why the universe hated me, and packed my shit up so i could go to tirana in the morning to get to a decently-sized hospital. #xb; after contemplating on wtf was wrong with my life on the bus trip, i got to the hostel, binge-ate, and slept in preparation for explaining why i thought i had rabies even though i didn’t actually have a bite wound (that’s right! he didn’t actually bite me! he didn’t break skin! i didn’t even bother asking my hostel-mates for reassurance this time though, i had already decided i was dying). during this time i got my mum to talk to my gp back home to ask if i had had the full-course of the rabies vaccine, or just the partial course. after hearing what had happened my doctor, who is one of the most precautious people i have met, told my mum i had nothing to worry about and i was fine. still went to the hospital though. there were like  doctors and nurses in the room looking at my thumb and trying to find the bite mark. turning my hand over, confused. getting a flashlight to see where on my hand this cat had bitten me. they told me i was fine (of course i was!) so i paid the  lek and left. #xb; miscellaneous because this is way too long: * pulled my back out, got a thai massage, felt worse the day after and decided i had irrevocable damaged my spine and i would be in pain for the rest of my life (spoiler: my back pain was cured the next day).
* met the coolest dudes in prishtina, hung out with them for a few days, and then got super-duper depressed when they left bc apparently i am not a normal human capable of processing emotions.
* got food poisoning in skopje and was sick for  weeks and genuinely thought i would never be able to enjoy food again (which was a horrifying thought for me because i’m a fat bitch and love food). * and most importantly: had bouts of depression throughout my trip. #xb; i feel like this is really important to talk about from both a mental illness and solo-travel standpoint. i’ve seen a lot of posts on /solotravel asking if traveling will cure or help with depression. while i do think that traveling can have a huge impact on how you view the world and in turn how you view yourself in the world, packing up and changing your location will not automatically make you feel better. there were times when i stayed in bed for most of the day. there were times when i wasn’t necessarily enjoying myself. there were times where i was physically and emotionally drained and all i wanted to do was make it back to my hostel. basically, there were times when i felt like i did at home when i was having a depressive episode. “wherever you go, there you are.” #xb; basically, what i’m saying is that traveling won’t cure your mental illness. what i am not saying, however, is that you shouldn’t travel just because you’re mentally ill. if you want to, and you’re well enough, you should! i really do think that meeting new people and seeing new places helped me grow and understand new things about myself and all that clichéd stuff. go into travel with the understanding that you’re not going to magically feel better, and understand that there might be times when your illness flares up and you feel like shit. that mentality is far healthier than one which treats the experience as a cure. #xb; tl;dr: some stupid and amusing stuff happened to me when i was travelling because of my ocd so i thought i’d share + some sappy rambling at the end about traveling and mental illness in general"

i'm not even including the leering by men everywhere since i'm used to that and can ignore it. i live in australia so i am more than familiar with the attitudes from south east asian countries since they are the easiest to get to and i thought of all of them sri lanka was the least friendly and everyone, and i mean everyone just saw me as a walking dollar sign which was the only time they where friendly. for comparison i felt safer in peru, bali and thailand. i could at least walk safely alone back m from dinner to a hotel at pm/pm and the sales people where much more friendly to deal with nor was i asked once a minute to jump in a rickshaw as i'm walking down the street."

(for context in currently going to a school in canada but i just dropped my courses this semester) when i solo traveled this went away. i was the person i wanted to be. people actually liked me. i could have an amazing day going to parties or just wandering around town doing nothing. i feel like i'm stuck here and while i might be able to change bit by bit in scared nothing will change and i'll grow up to be a looser. so that's it. i can't get the though of just disappearing out of my head. i'm scared if i think too long i'll get cold feet and just settle into my life staying stuck where i am. sorry about the clickbatey title and if this doesn't think here. i just want to get the perspective of people who have experienced just going somewhere new on their own.

it was a real confidence booster being able to venture on my own and know that i can be comfortable in my own company, and also comforting knowing there's a community to take advice and tips from! oh, and literally travelling solo was a breeze, probably the most relaxed and swift transfers and flights i've ever had!"

virgo4728,evchpn,0,1580249048,"hey guys! so end of february i’m doing a solo trip to bangkok for seven days. i have already booked a round trip flight there from the us. but now i’m thinking about splitting the trip up and maybe doing like  days in bangkok and  days in siem reap. the last few trips i’ve taken (cabo, istanbul) just felt like i didn’t need to be there a whole week, and while i enjoyed both places there was just a lot of time where i was bored, as i get bored very easily. so my question is, to those who have been to bangkok, do you think it’s worth it to stay a whole week? or should i throw in another trip? let me know what you think! p.s. i would be staying in hostels both places as i always do. i like to have time to party, and relax, i love visiting historical sites, and i love food. these are pretty much all things i look for when traveling"
Reddit__boi,evcjez,0,1580249217,"i am planning to go to india this summer for about  days, so around . weeks. i am probably going to fly to new delhi. do you guys recommend booking a return ticket from another airport? something like bangalore or mumbai? i don't know how fast i will travel and where exactly yet. i am considering either staying in the north (then i would just go back to new delhi) or going to the south and the coast (then i would fly from bangalore or mumbai) but i have no idea how fast i will travel or how reasonable this plan is. i backpacked europe past summer and i had a pretty high travelling speed, i am not the type to stick around in a city for more than a day or two, maybe three. but that is in european cities, i don't know what to expect from india and i guess i will probably want to see a bit more than in european cities. i am more of a nature type so i am curious what you guys think is best and reasonable."
appleinmyeye10,evdnvs,0,1580253535," posting a very unreasonable resolution from scoot. my southern asian vacation plan was disconnected due to my original departure location was from shanghai. i could not use the two bookings (taipei - singapore singapore - bangkok) reserved with is currently full/partial lock down right now. air china cancelled all the flights from shanghai to neighbor counties, even then, traveling right now is not responsible because of the potential of spreading virus. and there are  confirmed cases as well in bangkok, taipei, and singapore. scoot as an airline company is neither flexible and have no empathy to its customer in this circumstances, nor being considerate of the virus spreading threat. my all other reservation with hong kong airline and air canada are all considering flexible cancelation policy. it is a very disappointing experience with scoot."

) what 'fields' or 'time periods' of history do you like?
) favourite historical sites / history-themed travel experiences?
) places you'd like to see in the future that have a history slant? and anything else you'd like to add (maybe some recommendations for places to visit!) thanks for any response."

VagabondStilettos,evgu9b,0,1580267456,"i went to paris, france for my th birthday (just flew back into the us last night) and although my actual birthday was horrible due to the strikes closing down many stations, i had a wonderful time the rest of the days. i would like to touch on a few things that i was concerned about prior to going: # going to nightclubs, particularly as a woman surprisingly, this proved to be no issue whatsoever. i often found myself making new friends since i would fully immerse myself in the music, and dance like no one was watching. this allowed many people to come up and dance alongside me and in the end, we would exchange social media's. as a female, i would tell the men that approached me that i was there with my friends, **i would never reveal too much information about myself beyond my name and age** (for instance, if they were trying to *get to know me*, i would tell them 'it doesn't matter. i'm just trying to have a good time' and they would usually leave it at that.) i used basic common sense such as not getting shit-faced drunk, going home with strangers, leaving my drinks unattended, telling anyone where i was staying, etc. i always had a great time, and never came across anyone aggressive and yes, at times, i was making it home at around  in the morning (the latest i stayed out was :am.) # going out to eat for this, i had no issues as well. in fact, i didn't need a book or a journal while eating to keep me occupied. instead, i would listen in on everyone's conversation. if i heard a word being used a lot, i would google its meaning (for instance, 'bah ouais' was heard all of the time!) additionally, i would just sit and people watch or occasionally be on my phone in search of the next activity. # pickpockets never had a problem. i wore a ""fanny pack"" across my chest and kept my coat and scarf covering it since all of my essentials were in it. these were typically items i would have a hard time replacing while abroad such as my phone, money, identification, etc. occasionally, i would tuck it underneath my arm, still underneath my coat, but this only occurred if i wasn't wearing my scarf. i never kept anything i couldn't lose in my purse, so if i were to be pickpocketed, they would be stealing cough drops, an umbrella, some tissues... maps of paris... brochures, etc. haha! # harrassment yes, i was catcalled several times, but not nearly as often as anticipated. i didn't wear flashy clothing, i never smiled at anyone.. no really, i never looked anyone in the face while walking or sitting on the metro. i had rbf a majority of the time, and ignored anyone that bothered to attempt. my rbf is pretty intimidating. if any young women also plan to travel solo, especially to france, definitely don't hesitate to pm me! i had gone to several tourist attractions as well where the men could be pretty aggressive with tourists and especially if you appear to be alone and i handled them all with ease. i was in france for  weeks by myself which doesn't seem like much in comparison to some people, but given that this was my very first time, i feel quite accomplished and can definitely offer what worked for me! *tl;dr* *first solo trip was a success. i had no issues with aggression, thieves, or simply enjoying my time alone in clubs or restaurants. pm me for any questions and/or advice!*"

KeysToTheRoc,egtkho,0,1577554720,so this is my very rough itinerary of my trip to egypt in february. i am mainly visiting for the historical sites although i'd like to spend a couple days in a beautiful location to simply relax. i like to get off the beaten path also as it can be draining dealing with people in the tourism industry for a prolonged period of time. #xb; **feb  - cairo:** my flight is scheduled to arrive at  am so i was thinking of booking a hotel for the first night as hostels don't have a  hour check in. **feb  - cairo**: pyramids of giza and the museum of egyptian antiquities. and generally just exploring cairo. **feb - - aswan**: will take a flight from cairo to aswan. have heard many great things about aswan although i am not sure what there is to see besides a day trip to abu simbel. **feb  - - luxor**: going to have to weigh up the travel options here but most likely will take the train up to luxor. valley of the king's and karnak temple are the main sites i will visit here. i will travel back to cairo in the evening of the th **feb  - fly home** tdlr: cairo aswan luxor cairo i did initially want to visit dahab for its beauty but heard its kind of a hassle to travel to from cairo and i can't swim so not sure if there would be any point for me. a few other questions: any activities you'd recommended or must visit places in egypt? are the touts worse than in morocco? i look middle eastern so i never got hassled when i wasn't hauling my luggage. how is the hostel scene in egypt?
jml011,egtzvp,0,1577556737,"as the title above stated, i am gearing up for a rather long period of travel around the fertile crescent and into india and s.e. asia. i plan to lean on hostels and couchsurfing for accommodations, supplementing these with camping where applicable. hotels and airbnb will be distant fourth and fifth option. i have never been east of italy and never stayed in a hostel, at least other than some run by relatively large volunteer organizations and while with a group of people i knew well. further, i have never tried to do any work while abroad, since i've never had a trip longer than three weeks. my questions lay within these blind spots. work and hostels: * so, i have saved up enough that i should be set for the entirety of the trip even if i have to pay for everything out of pocket and don't earn anything a long the way. with that said, i am always looking to cut costs where i can so that i am well-set upon my return. i have seen many people reference putting in work at a hostel in exchange for accommodations there for the night. is this a common exchange or really more of an exception? i assume there is only so much to be done at them, and if more than just few people come looking for the same exchange, there are diminishing returns for the hostel to allow multiple people to do this.
* an extension of the above, has anyone had any luck finding temporary work (like, a few days or a week—just any kind of labor) along the way? do you use craigslist? is there another recommended app i should be using? do you just go door-to-door at businesses? what kind of legal trouble could you land in trying to find work without a visa? any experience in this department would be greatly appreciated. security. * a few things here. first, do hostels have lockers or similar ways to store your bag during the night, or while you are out in the day? if so, do they typically have locks or should i bring my own? i plan to use a luggage lock on my bag, but should i bring a heavier padlock? has theft in hostel (or from your hotel, couchsurfing, or airbnb) ever been a problem you have experienced?
* second, would a bluetooth security device, specifically tile, be a worthwhile investment? are tile users ubiquitous enough to warrant their use? i can easily imagine dropping the money on them, only for my bag to be stolen and there is still no one within the ecosystem close enough to pick up its location—even if the thief had not found the tile and discarded or destroyed it. how many people bother with this kind of thing? i will have my surface pro and my fujifilm x-t set up with me, and loosing them and especially the projects i am working on contained within them are a concern. (no, i will not considered leaving them at home.) any advice on these subjects would be greatly appreciated. happy holidays!"

sabucoush,eh5vjx,0,1577625863,"hi, i am currently on long trip that sometimes i have anxiety of losing my debit card since its my only source of money and it made it even worse because i had a semi unpleasant experience: ) on friday evening i wanted to withdraw money from a machine that was not working. gladly it returned the card back. however
• if the card was not returned it would be considered “void” • i would have to wait for the next business day (monday) for them to perhaps open the atm and give me back my card • the card is void since it was not returned as normal (maybe not i am not sure) ) my other anxious thought is that being robbed or snitched. i sometimes think maybe its better if i withdraw a big amount in cash and keep my card at my hostel but: • its really hard to keep track once start spending cash specially when its smaller bills and coins • its not practical and inconvenient in situation of emergency. what are your thoughts on this matter? thank you,"

kelctea,eh7usw,0,1577636957,"hey everyone. if you’re wondering what the point to this post is, good question; i probably don’t have an answer for you. i think i just need to vent to people who might be able to understand. i’m very sorry for the long post. for the past year and a half, i’ve worked full time in an extraordinarily stressful job in one of australia’s largest public hospitals with one goal in mind: save enough money for a  month solo backpacking trip across europe. in , i was in the uk for a month solo, and i had the time of my life, so i figured i at least had some small idea of what i was getting myself into. i’m now  years old, about to knuckle down at uni for the next three years, and i thought “now’s the time”. i’d planned everything in advance, to the most minute detail. this may have been a mistake in itself, as now i have zero flexibility when i need it, but i have an anxiety disorder and wanted to have all my movements/accommodation set in stone. i landed in london on december th, and am now in berlin. from here, i was planning on going to prague, krakow, vienna, amongst other places, and then down into italy. problem is, where i had no issues with solo travelling on my first trip in  in the uk, now i seem to be facing an uphill battle. my anxiety is through the roof, and is not being controlled by meds i have been taking (i felt absolutely fine back home). i read a lot of stories about social anxiety completely disappearing for a lot of people while they’re travelling, and i definitely found that to be true the first time i did this. however, now i’m finding myself regularly going almost  hours without eating, simply because i’m too petrified to navigate the language barrier with restaurants/grocery stores and make a fool of myself or upset the waiter/cashier. i’m truly terrible at navigation, so i have to be glued to google maps constantly when i’m out and walking around, which i feel like paints a bullseye on my back as a tourist. in addition to this crippling anxiety, i’m also incredibly sad and lonely. i’m craving human connection, and can’t help feeling that i would much rather be doing this with friends, which is insane because i barely have any friends to begin with, and the ones i do have i would detest travelling with. because my anxiety is in overdrive, i can’t bring myself to go to a bar or anything like that to rectify this side of things, and wouldn’t feel safe doing so anyway. on this point, one of the other major issues is that i’m what i would describe as semi-attractive, and more so when i put in some effort. it’s very obvious that i’m alone and nervous. i’ve been assaulted by men twice in the past  hours, in public spaces, no less - and nobody did or said anything to stop it. i just completely froze up and kept saying “please stop, please stop, please stop” over and over again until eventually a well-timed distraction would come about, like my train arriving on the platform. in berlin, i’m staying in a hostel which has  beds -  are currently occupied by a group of indian men, and i am the only female. i have another week here. it is extremely awkward for me, and they have been showing me some attention, to the point where i enquired at reception if i could be moved to a room with more females, but the staff refused, saying that they don’t keep track of which genders are staying in their dorms. if i move hostels now, i lose about $aud. with this anxiety, and these experiences over the past while, i’m considering just pulling the pin and heading home. i honestly don’t feel confident heading further east, if i’m having this much trouble now. my family is extremely disappointed in me, and keep reminding me of this wonderful opportunity that i’m throwing away, as if that isn’t already at the forefront of my mind. but i’m not happy. i’m not enjoying my time here. i’m completely torn. i’ve wanted this for so long, to see these places and live these experiences, but i’m concerned that my headspace is not conducive to getting through this in one piece. i mean, i’m barely even eating. so, my question - what would you do? would you soldier through, with everything booked and all travel paid for in advance, feeling shit scared and lonely but also knowing this is what you worked for? or would you fork out what amounts to be almost the rest of your money to return home early, to safety, but also to a family who wishes you were still gone? (my family loves me, by the way. they just have a habit of living vicariously through me and are taking even the suggestion of my coming home as a personal affront, as if they themselves are here with me and i’m forcibly dragging them onto the plane too). thank you for bearing with me here, i know this has been long. if you have any thoughts at all, i would really like to hear them."

Woosharoundtg,ehmfog,0,1577714813,"hey reddit! i’m taking my little brother to italy on june th and showing him around italy for  days. i’ve spent a total of  months in italy already so i know it fairly well. the only countries my brother has been to are canada and the bahamas. his birthday is in may so i figured i’d take him to italy since he’s wanted to go for so long. my plan is to show him rome, cinque terre, venice, and florence. we will be landing in rome on the th and staying  nights until the th. on the th, we will take a train to cinque terre and stay for  nights. on the th we will be taking a train to venice and stay  nights. on the th we will be going to florence and staying for  nights. on the th, we would be going back to rome and he will go home that afternoon. i’ll be in rome a bit longer. i’m not completely sure what my plans will be after he leaves. i definitely won’t be going back to the states. i don’t really have any plans from then on until late august/early september, so i’m open to ideas. we will be staying in hostels. all of which are rated above  on hostelworld. two of the hostels i’ve been to myself so i can vouch for them and the other two are hostels my friends have recommended to me. for the ones i haven’t been to, the reviews on hostelworld sing the same praises my friends have. overall, the total cost for all of the hostels we will be staying at during our trip is $ usd per person, so that’s about €. in rome we will be seeing the main sights, most of which are free. as far as paid activities go, we will go into the colosseum, and go to the vatican. our time in rome will be spent walking around the city and one night we will be doing the colosseum bar crawl. in cinque terre we will only do  small paid activities. one is the hike from corniglia to vernazza, which is cheap and only requires a cinque terre card. if you’re not used to hikes, don’t worry, it’s easy, and this is coming from a guy who did it out of shape and sick. the other paid activity is renting a beach chair in monterosso al mare. our trip to cinque terre will be spent relaxing in the water, going on one hike, and trying some local foods. next trip is venice. the paid activities will be doge’s palace and a gondola ride. our time in venice will be spent exploring and trying local foods. last stop is florence. we are doing the duomo, and galleria dell’accademia as the paid activities. if we have more time than we may see another sight as well. mostly we will be exploring the many free sights in florence and eating some great food, of course. if you’re interested in tagging along with us on our  location trip, we would be happy to have you. or if you’d like to make travel plans with me for after my brother leaves then feel free to comment or send me a message. i’m open to suggestions for what to do when my brother leaves, so we could plan something together, or if you’re already doing something then i’ll tag along."

ShepardtoyouSheep,e3vfd6,0,1575116016,"thought i'd give a complete breakdown of our trip to belgium this last week for others who might be interested in going. budget: under $, trip length:  days destination: brussels accomodations: studio apartment airbnb activities: - beer museum - european history museum - life in brussels museum - comic strip museum - day trip to bruges - torture museum - museum of art and history what went right: overall we absolutely loved our entire trip and would love to head back at some point. when we do head back, we won't be spending much of our time in brussels again though and will aim for more time in bruges and other smaller cities. we loved all the various museums and architecture of the city. what went wrong: nothing went extremely wrong, but there were a few items that we would have enjoyed happening differently or not at all. first, our airbnb was located on an extremely busy street and that meant a ton of noise every single night. second, we got in at am, which is normally great, but we didn't sleep at all on the flight over so we were exhausted on day  and couldn't get into our lodging until pm. we basically just sat around and waited to get into it so we could take a quick nap before hitting the town. lastly, we did have an interesting interaction with a man on the street one morning. as i was locking the door my fiance waited on the sidewalk when a man approached her and asked if she spoke english. when i entered the sidewalk he looked at both of us and turned to my fiance and said ""fuck you"" and stormed off. recommendations: research your lodging and read all the reviews you can. don't be afraid to ask questions about it or the neighborhood it's in. final verdict: would go again. full cost breakdown: - flights: $ round trip each - airbnb: $ for  nights - day : $ (travel day, groceries, and a few pints) - day : $ (museum of european history and walking in parks) - day : $ (grand place, beer museum, brussels museum, groceries) - day : $ (comic museum, gifts, dinner) - day : $ trip to bruges - day : $ museum of art and history feel free to ask me anything."

valera1sandra,e48f45,0,1575167185,"компания r/solotravel и волчица негреческая греция *соло* \* бюджет: \* \* длина поездки: \* \* направление (ы): \* \*проживание:\* \*мероприятия:\* \* что пошло правильно: \* \*что пошло не так:\* \* рекомендации: \* \* окончательный вердикт: \* \*картинки!:\* вы также можете найти этот пост в боковой панели! полигональная кладка в дельфах, мегалиты в тиринфе и идеально выпиленные блоки в микенах. технологии, о которых греки периода архаики и классики знать не знали. о многих из них не знают и сейчас. каменными и медными орудиями труда сделать такое невозможно. откуда же взялись эти стены, дома и прочие руины? кто и когда их построил. все города классической греции так или иначе привязаны к морю, к портам. вся экономика полисов была связана с торговлей, а торговля - это море. были свои исключения. например, спарта. но у нее были свои порты на побережье. а вот микены. город в предгорьях, до воды  километров. зачем он здесь. и точнее, когда он был построен. официально xiii-xi вв до н.э. и слои этого периода можно действительно увидеть на городище. это кривой рваный камень, сложенный в толстые стены, среди которые прорублены условные ворота-проходы. а вот под этими «самыми старыми» слоями находятся абсолютно ровные блоки, у которых есть выпилы, сняты фаски и имеются пропилы с идеально ровной поверхностью. причем пропил имеет форму углубления, одна стенка которого абсолютно плоская, а вторая сколота. так пилят камень в наше время при помощи дисковых пил. а в микенах такие блоки лежат в основании пола строений xiii века до нашей эры. то есть микенцы строили свои дома на еще более древних руинах, от которых остались только плиты пола. стены и своды не сохранились, либо были использованы при строительстве в виде битого камня. вывод прост. под более грубым и нетехнологичным слоем мы видим архитектурные предметы более технологичной обработки. разумеется, в официальном описании микен как археологического памятника упоминания об этих блоках и пропилах вы не найдете. но есть и более очевидные вещи, которые не спрячешь ни от кого. это герб со львами над воротами города. вроде бы все просто – символ династии и т.п. но только через центр герба до его середины в продольном плане вновь идет пропил. тут уже без сколов. именно до середины, то есть пилить обычной медной пилой, которая работает по всей дине, было не возможно. такой пропил возможен только при наличии именно дисковой пилы. второй вопрос – зачем вообще понадобилось пилить герб пополам. сравнивая технологию его изготовления и соседние грубые стены, складывается полное ощущение, что его сюда принесли или из другого места, или, скорее всего, нашли на уже имевшихся здесь руинах, и встроили в новый город в xiii веке до н.э. в пользу последней версии говорят массивные прямоугольные блоки, из которых сложены сами ворота и прилегающие стены. они сильно контрастируют с другими постройками, да и с самой крепостной стеной. здесь технология кладки из многотонных квадров была, а рядом не было? или ворота сложили из валявшихся в округе обломков предыдущего города? на такую мысль наталкивают гробницы микенского типа. правда, к ним приписывают два разнородных по структуре типа памятников. это купольные склепы высотой до  метров в округе микен. они выложены в линейно идеальной структуре, перекрытия выполнены из блоков весом более  тонн. а есть многочисленная группа склепов подобной формы, но сложенная криво, из рваного камня, из которого построена большая часть стен микен. не говорит ли это о подобии, но не равенстве? что кто-то, то есть микенцы времен агамемнона, нашли остатки былой культуры, от которой мало что сохранилось в самом городе, но подземные склепы были не повреждены. они вторично использовали обломки для строительства нового города в xiii веке. а в могилы положили своих царей, считая эти места святыми. не так ли поступили советские вожди с кремлевской стеной, возведенной за  лет до них? и не так ли делали фараоны iii-iv династий с великими пирамидами? кстати, дромос, то есть вход-коридор в курган агамемнона вроде сложен подобно основой кладке. но ряды в нем кривые. то есть построен он был не создателями гробницы, а теми, кто пытался, но не умел следовать предложенной технологии. к размышлению. лабиринт круглой формы с впускными гробницами в нижней части микен. аналога ему в греции я не видел, но встречал подобное на мальте. подобная структура там относится на  тысяч лет назад. она также сложена из грубого камня, но имеет совершенно чуждую для всех остальных построек в округе форму. и построена она была также позже разрушения зданий из блоков с пропилами. не менее интересен соседний тиринф. в его центральной и самой высокой части, под грудой мелкого «самого древнего» камня в изобилии представлены блоки с пропилами. причем пропилы имеют длину в несколько метров, оконтуривая прежнюю площадь разрушенного помещения. уже поверх этих квадров выстроена огромная толстенная стена. причем выстроена она методом простого навала грубых камней, без всякой рядности. в ней имеются проходы-ворота с перекрытием в виде ступенчатого свода. то есть строители этих стен не могли перекрыть портал крупным блоком. они не знали, как поднимать тяжелые камни. но при этом в полу города уложены камни со следами совершенно иной технологичной обработки. кто основал микены и тиринф? как были обработаны камни, из которых построены эти города? для этого нужно копать глубже, разбирать грубые поделки xiii века до н.э. добираться до основания скалы. но на это современная наука пойти не может. ведь в первую очередь любой археологический объект – это зрелище. не важно, что на % - это реконструкция второй половины xx века. но она имеет «фасад», она совпадает с официальной теорией. чтобы на нее посмотреть, сюда едут сотни тысяч туристов, которые смотрят, но не видят, не думают. но самое интересное наследие догреческой греции – это дельфы. храм аполлона, легенда о пупе земли, камне, брошенном зевсом с небес. посмотри на камни глазами скептика. уберем реконструированные колонны – главный задник для всех фотографий, и посмотрим на основание. а в основании настоящая полигональная кладка. блоки не идут в ряд. они сложены, словно кривой тетрис. при этом грани настолько идеально прилегают друг к другу, что лезвие не везде можно просунуть. подумайте, как можно вырезать камень в скале с кривыми гранями так, чтобы он идеально совпал с - блоками, лежащими вокруг него? без компьютера, на глаз. никак! любой архитектор и дизайнер скажет, что камни резали по трафарету на единой поверхности, а потом воссоздавали на новом месте. аналогичную полигональную платформу я видел в перу и в иране в персеполе. причем старая ограда дельф, в которой уже были прорублены проходы в античное время, к которой пристроен верхний стадион, также имеет подобную кладку. ни один гид, ни один путеводитель о ней не упоминает. храм аполлона стоит на этой платформе, его основание выложены из подобных блоков. и во всех легендах говориться, что это место уже было святым в архаический период истории греции, в нем жил сам аполлон. а большинство стен и храмов – это уже позднее напластование. кстати, внизу, в старом храме афины, в строении, относимом к до-архаическому периоду также встречается полигональная кладка. наличие факта мы удостоверили. понимаем, что греки построить это не могли. потому что, если могли, то и дальше строили так же по всей греции. зачем? это идеальная кладка в сейсмоопасных регионах. в ней нет ни вертикальных, ни горизонтальных слое. по сути, это монолит из мозаики. он не рушится при толчках. все блоки находятся словно в замке. нет оси разрушения. если бы это строили греки, то весь полуостров был бы застроен только такими домами, которым не страшна сила вулканов и земли. но нет, такого больше нет нигде. кто же это построил? греки сами отвечают на этот вопрос. их боги, которые и жили в таких строениях. и под ними они понимали не творца, а более сильных, живущих дольше, но все же людей. святость появилась тогда, когда ушло понимание и знание. осталась вера и непонимание. ведь для полинезийцев в тихом океане белые солдаты тоже были богами, они молились им. по-настоящему. ведь те могли летать на стальных птицах. я долго искал подобную кладку в храме аполлона в бассах. ничего. предыдущее строение было полностью снесено и на его место выстроен абсолютно новый храм. хотя по древности и святости место не уступает дельфам. продолжаем искать. египет, иран, ливан, израиль, палестина, перу, боливия – в этих странах можно убедиться, что технологии айфона окажутся допотопными по сравнению с наследием цивилизации (ий), присутствовавшей на нашей планете около  тысяч лет назад. дмитрий алешкин"

simplyTools,dpd3pt,0,1572470588,"tldr: the title mainly . although the last line is a little misleading: there is this event happening in chennai that i am a part of, so i am mainly going there to attend that . but i will be there a day earlier so i was thinking of living some of my childish fantasies to roam in some unknown place, visit some interesting places, meet people eat some cool cuisine and other stuff, for  day. i have planned this journey thoroughly, read it below. mainly this  day could be handled in either **adventure mode** : where i check in to hotel, go out visit places , meet people and make this memorable or **cowardly safemode** : where i check in to my hotel, take a big nap, then watch movies on my phone and do some work for full day . i am all about going full adventure mode but my thing is , am hell of an awkward, simpleton and stupid personna . wanna read more of my foolishness then read the later paras. i was mainly here wondering for tips regarding safe travel, particularly in respect to the part where you talk to anonymous ppl. # questions - how do you judge which person is good or which person is a red flag to talk to? - also,if you like gaining local culture knowledge, will you just grab some random local citizen and casually start asking questions? how do you start?(and am not talking about those monuments and tourist places. for eg, you are interested in a (unique for you but common for locals) mailbox. ) - what information you think should never be given to a stranger and which information ( like your name, country name, etc ) you feel is okay to share to that random stranger? ( obviously bank accounts , cash details, etc are things which we should never talk about. but am talking about things related to you or your journey : like accomodation info, your plans for visiting places, etc . which beans will you spill nd which you wouldn't,in order to talk to someone) also ,note that stranger here could mean  types of people: the one that i will meet in the event, probably also tourists, sharing common interests , useful to my career growth and might meet me in some other event. or the trues strangers , the local people there, someone near our previous mailbox? # about my plannings i am carrying  bags and i have around  backups of my tickets and id. my other bag is mainly clothes , but my main bag would have some electricals like chargers earphones, powerbanks , etc . i am carrying some cash, all put at different places, along with a debit card and some money in ewallets. i have some zippers and safety pins if anything goes wrong. my hotel is booked but i will be paying when i reach there... well that's pretty much it. let me know if i should look into some other thing # about me i am  and am still making a lot of mistakes.... sigh. i am mainly introvert( can't talk to people/won't talk to people... sadly both are same for me) , simpleton (got scammed many times , the latest one just a month ago ), a single child ( i tell you its not so goody. my parents are super extra over-caring : my mom used to watch over me when i went to a tution in class th, all the way until i was out of sight , a tution that wasn't even  mtrs away!) and so less confident. i am taking steps to change what i could, and this journey was a part of it. i took it because not only this was a great event that i could attend, but i am in the volunteer team meaning i have a reason to interact with people somewhat. plus this would be an event where there might be people with similar interests there. i just ... hope that i am able talk to some important people, make friends , talk calmly to strangers and walk boldly."
joanofarc31,dpd7q7,0,1572471052,"my boyfriend and i are planning to travel in peru starting from mid may for about  days or so. we'd really like to know how much funds we should be looking at per person, expect airfares. we are not looking for any luxurious accomodations or meals and are willing to stay in budget hotels, hostels and airbnb wherever possible. i got know know about a bus service known as peru hop and it seems like a good idea to travel from lima all the the way to cusco in a bus and maybe stopping in-between wherever we want to. we are also planning to trek to the rainbow mountain. over all we want to spend as less as possible (we're grad students) but not compromise on the local cuisine or any important places of attraction. any help in this regard is much appreciated."
sorcererballer,dpdh6y,0,1572472145,"i can definitely say that solo travel and worldwide exploration is pretty much my greatest joy and passion in life, but i have sadly been on hiatus for the last  years due to parenthood. but at long last, with the full blessing of family, i am able to get away and answer the call to adventure! it's only for a week, but cuba has been on my list for  years. i'm not even really going to plan much; just grab a lonely planet and browse the r/cuba sub and see what happens. being a solo traveler was such a essential part of my identity, it was really hard to give it up during these years of early childhood parenting. i think becoming a parent can be a bit of an identity-crushing experience as it is. i honestly feel quite out of touch with the ""essential me"" and i am really hoping to take this upcoming journey to reconnect with that part of myself that is a distant memory. the part that finds no greater thrill than just to step off a plane in an unknown and completely foreign environment, with all that i need on my back, with the freedom to go wherever i please, to set my sails and see where the wind blows. experiences like that will bring me back to my core. and the best part--this is just the first trip! with my family on board, this kind of thing can happen regularly for me now, and longer and in more far-flung locations as the children age. woooooohoooooooo!!!!!!!! it feels great to be back. thanks for reading and sharing my joy."

(the uk portion of my trip is static and i have a designated day that i will be leaving, but i haven't % decided to which eu country i'll be going to because i want to keep it semi-flexible). i will, however, be getting an unlimited -month eurail pass and will only stay in the schengen area for the maximum of  days of course, but i was wondering if the eurail pass is technically proof of onward travel? i know i'll need this info to even board the plane from canada to england, so i just need to know whether an itinerary + eurail pass will suffice? also, will the immigration in each schengen country ask for proof of onward travel while traveling by train? if so, i'm planning to go to croatia anyway, so i can pre-book that if need be. thanks a lot for your help!"

barynski,dpfbxz,0,1572480154,"i recently decided to take a solo trip to europe for a  week period in january. i know it will be cold and all but it's going to be the only opportunity to travel i'll have in a while, and i don't mind the cold that much anyway. anyway, i've booked my flight in and out, as well as my first and last hostel, but everything else is fluid and subject to change. dec - | fly into berlin from msp

jan - | krakow, poland
jan - | sanok, poland
jan - | budapest
jan - | amsterdam
jan  | amsterdam-msp in berlin i plan on visiting museums, going to a new years eve party (possibly discotheque? not sure which party is best), and i would also like to go to a rave/disco, because that's the stereotype i think of when i think of berlin haha. no definitive plans as of yet for prague. in krakow i would like to visit the salt mines and auschwitz. i would also like to explore the city, and i feel like these tours would take full days so i might try to take a night train/bus to give me more time. the only reason i'm going to sanok is because it has a museum with a zdzislaw beksinski gallery. he's probably my favorite artist, so i feel like i can't pass up an opportunity to see his work in person. this would also give me a small break from cities, and i couldn't find any hostels here so i would likely get a hotel room for myself. in budapest i would explore the city, ruin bars, museums, etc. haven't thought too much about it yet. i didn't originally plan on amsterdam, but the best flight i could find time-wise and money-wise out of budapest had an overnight layover in amsterdam, so i figured might as well. i do plan to go out at night and ideally not miss my am flight back to america. thoughts: should i spend more time in budapest/krakow? i've heard two nights in prague is enough, so i'm considering cutting my stay in berlin a night short -- although i already booked the hostel for  nights, so hopefully they would let me drop a night without canceling the whole reservation. i hope to budget roughly $ (usd) for the trip, excluding travel costs, so roughly $ per night - hopefully this is excessive, but i feel like i might spend a good amount in berlin and amsterdam. i would like to go out for at least one night in each city, but i'm not a party animal so it definitely won't be every night. i also plan on not splurging too much on food/drink, and i'll try to buy groceries a couple times if possible. if you have any critiques on my itinerary or thoughts on fun things to do in any of the cities, let me know!"
majesticmile,dpg1pf,0,1572483425,"hey reddit! i have three weeks off for christmas break this year and really miss travelling so am considering spending  weeks solo-travelling through mexico instead of going home for christmas. my only concerns are . the solo-traveller/hostel culture in mexico. i've been looking at hostels on hostelworld and they look pretty good but i dont know anyone whose solo-travelled mexico so would love to hear some experiences from redditors. is is easy to meet people? my other travel experiences were in europe (where i found eastern europe to be the best social experience by far)--how does the travel culture compare?
. the fact that it'll be december/early january--im worried that there will be a lot of families/groups but also i intend to go to mexico city, guadalajara, etc. as opposed to tourist towns/beaches so maybe i'll avoid it.
. also any suggestions for locations/hostels would be amazing!"

def_cats,dpkcsf,0,1572508811,"so i was walking to my hostel in seoul, i was walking off of the main road so there were only a few people on the street, but it wasn’t empty at all. i was listening to music and this korean couple stopped me as i was walking and asked if i knew where the harry potter cafe was. i said no sorry but i could look it up for them if they wanted me to. they were insistent that i didn’t and that they’d be fine and it didn’t matter if they found it or not. they were totally friendly, and asked me if i worked for nasa (i was wearing a nasa t-shirt), then asked if it was my first time in seoul. anyway we were standing there chatting for about  minutes and it was really a pleasant encounter. i admit they seemed a little too excited to be talking to me, something just seemed a little bit off. then another korean couple walks by and as they walked behind the couple that was talking to me the male turns to me and starts shaking his head and mouthing “no no no” while making an x with his arms like this 🙅‍♂️ i acted like i didn’t see anything and as the couple turned the corner the guy yelled something like “they’re _____”. i didn’t catch what he said. the girl that was standing in front of me turns and says “what did he say?” and i said “i’m not sure honestly”. then the girl says “oh it’s because there is a lot of crime in seoul” then she says a few things in korean to her boyfriend and she starts to act like she barely understands english even though they were talking totally fine before. anyway they continued to be friendly and keep the conversation going but i cut them off shortly after, wished them the best, and walked away. they smiled and bowed to me and shook my hand and left. i admit, i always have my guard up when i’m abroad since i travel alone but nothing about this seemed like they were trying to scam me. i know a common scam is for someone to take you out for tea or whatever and charge you a ton of money but they never tried to ask me to go anywhere. they were young, probably no older than . the look on the guys face who waved at me wasn’t one of annoyance at a scam, it was more like he was scared and worried. it was an extremely bizarre experience. i asked my hostel owner about it and he just shrugged it off and said not to worry about it. i want to know what you guys think. thoughts?"

* sevilla ( nights)
* granada ( nights)
* barcelona ( nights) - * marseille ( nights) - or another southern france city/town, haven’t decided yet
* nice-monaco ( nights) * milan ( night) - a night stop so trip to switzerland is not too long.
* interlaken / gimmewald ( nights) - looks beautiful like to hike so i think the extra money is worth it
* milan ( nights) - lake como day trip
* cinque terra ( nights) * florence ( nights) - thinking of day trip to bologne/modena to check out ferrari / pagani.
* siena ( nights)
* rome (  nights)
* naples ( nights) - almafi coast + capri + pompei day trips (not sure if too stay in the city or around like pompeii or sorrento)
* venice ( nights)

BenjiSupertramp,dbgt3b,0,1569871621,"i feel like more and more solo travelers start losing their common sense these days. why do so many people out there trivialize how dangerous some situations and countries can get? **“i could also get robbed at home.”** i have heard this argument a billion times. last time told by a blonde norwegian guy in south africa. **”i have been here for  days and nothing has happened to me. this country is safe.”** how do people not even realize that this doesn’t prove a thing? the fact that nothing happens to oneself doesn’t mean that a country is safe, same as something happening doesn’t necessarily mean a country is dangerous. **”the locals say it rarely happens.”** when couchsurfing abroad a while ago, i asked my host if cars being high jacked really was a thing. he said it rarely happens. it only happens to his aunt, to his brother, to his grandpa and to some of his colleagues at work. in my country hell would break loose if a car had been highjacked at gunpoint. the media would talk about it for days. **“the locals say it’s safe.”** again. the devil is in the detail. your semantics might not be theirs. what a danish person calls “ghetto” might be different from what a moroccan person deems as “ghetto”. young solo backpackers get drunk, stick out like a sore thumb, usually have got a language barrier and tend to get this attitude that everyone will be friendly and welcoming to them. just feel like we should get rid of this attitude of acting like solo traveling is all roses. encouraging people to go out and see the world is a good thing, however, telling people the *arguments* above ends up with lots of them in shitty situations. i like to do dangerous things myself once in a while, however, part of it is to acknowledge the situations as they are. last but not least, solo traveling exacerbates most dangerous aspects about traveling. what do you think about these arguments above? ever heard travelers using them before? maybe used them yourself?"

droidekas,dc3t74,0,1569982051,this is a question for us based solo travelers who've hit the road for an extended period and had no home while doing it. what have you done to receive mail? i was thinking of a po box but wondering about the limitations of that. like what happens when it gets full? i have tried to switch as much as my mail as possible to electronic so that would help a bit. also how do you maintain an address with no home for things like health care? i'm in the state of washington if that matters.
HorsinAround1996,dc42v6,0,1569983407,"i had originally booked a solo trip to colombia for september, but had to push it back a month due to a family illness. i have used this extra time to work extensively on my spanish via duolingo, i leave in two weeks and i’m at a point where i think i’ll do ok with basic interactions. however, i am struggling with certain nuances, for example: “he needs help” is translated to “él necesita ayuda” whereas i would think necesito would be correct as it’s the masculine form. this is just one of many examples where i struggle with such nuances. my question is will this be an issue when interacting with locals, i’m concerned my spanish will either come of as jibberish or worse yet offend locals. i’m hoping i’m just being overly anxious and it’ll just be like a foreign person doing their best to speak broken english here. any insight would be much appreciated."

JustinGitelmanMusic,dc4wl8,0,1569987854,hey! i was curious what first impressions people might get viewing the [beer travel guide]() in /r/neworleansbeer in terms of how helpful it might be to a hypothetical solo traveler in particular. does anybody have any thoughts? does the arrangement generally make sense? is there any info you wish was easily displayed/organized that would make it easier for you to narrow down what stuff you'd be potentially interested in? any considerations that are very common for solo travel that someone wouldn't normally think of? thanks!
SakanaToDoubutsu,dc4yv9,0,1569988220," my girlfriend is vietnamese and i'll be traveling there to meet her parents this december. on our way there, i'm planning to stop in japan to meet up with some old friends and do some other things, and want to bring some alcohol home with me. i've never had a problem before traveling back to the united states with alcohol from japan, but i was warned by my girlfriend that the vietnamese customs agents may steal it on my way through or extort it from me by charging extreme inport/export taxes. she is leaving before me so i won't have anyone to help me through customs upon entering the country. has anyone ever traveled to and from vietnam with alcohol and how can i expect to be treated as an american heading through customs?"

alexs1214,cxmsvx,0,1567198605,"hi all! i'm trying to decide on a trip this fall. i currently live in panama and have been to very few countries in central/south america. after some research, i've been super intrigued by ecuador and peru. i will be traveling solo from panama, have about a week in **early november** (if that makes a difference), and am primarily interested in doing some trekking/nature stuff. here's what i was thinking for my options: **ecuador**: my main interest in ecuador is going to cotopaxi park and staying at the secret garden hostel. i would fly into quito and stay  night there, then do  days and  nights in cotopaxi. all in all, not too pricey a trip. the park looks incredible and i'm in love with the idea of the secret garden hostel and all of the activities that can be done there like hikes and horseback riding. i lean towards picking this option, but is cotopaxi exciting enough to be the focus of my whole trip? is there anything else i could consider adding for the remaining  or so days? **peru**: i'm wayyyy too late/broke to do a whole inca trail set up, but i've read a lot about the salkantay trek and the lares trek. i'm considering heading to cusco, staying a few days in town to acclimate and signing up for a multi day hike like one of those two. this would be a more serious trekking trip and i don't have a ton of experience with that (though am an athletically fit, so i'm less worried about the strenuous aspect as much as i am about the altitude/needing to purchase a bunch of new clothing/accessories). this would be a more involved trip and more expensive, but also probably worth it to hike in the andes and see machu picchu (even if i don't hike to the sun gate) and other ruins. it looks so incredible. so my question is, for a solo traveller with about a week to spare in november, which of these two would you choose and why? alternatively, if you emphatically feel i should head to a different country, where? i've been to colombia and mexico, and from panama the flights most similar/lower in price to these two would be costa rica, guatemala, nicaragua, honduras, and belize.  years old, woman, usa, intermediate spanish"

mclovin215,cxyc3g,0,1567273649,"this is the summary of  trips to europe i made in the last  months ( nights in summer ,  nights during the winter, and  nights this summer). i explored through  towns/cities, stayed overnight in  of them, slept in  beds and walked more than , km in  days about me: /m/bangladeshi living in the us. i like reading history, going to historic places, chatting up everyone at the hostel, throwing shapes to electronic music and buying pints i can’t afford for strangers when i’m drunk. from the places i had the chance to visit, i made a **bunch of top- lists** for different categories of stuff that were interesting to me (see below). please feel free to suggest more categories and i will try to add those them to this post if i they sound interesting. i also kept a spreadsheet throughout my trip for each city (how i know how many km i walked, how many beds i slept in etc etc) so here’s a complete list of the places i visited and how long i was in each of them. []() you may notice that i spent a lot of time ( days) in krakow. i was working remotely for  weeks this summer and needed a place that: ) i loved ) was cheap enough for me to rent out an airbnb for a month. krakow was an easy pick after last summer’s adventures. i also spent a lot of time in stockholm because i am probably moving there at some point and wanted to get a good feel for the city. also freakin loved the nightlife and people there, so was hard to leave. other than the micro-states, the only countries in europe i didn’t go to were norway, switzerland, belarus and ukraine. skipped the first  because of how expensive they were and the last  for visa issues. last year was my first time visiting mainland europe, but i also studied abroad in reykjavik from dec - june , so had to squeeze iceland into some of my top  lists i am planning on writing a blog post summing up these trips with a lot of pictures. i am posting this here first to get a feel of what others would find interesting and would want to know more about. hit me up with any questions, and i will try to answer them here as well. here goes the lists :) #  favorite places for hanging out with locals . poland (krakow + warsaw)- polish young people were super-friendly to me everywhere i went. literally crossed the border over from lithuania one time and immediately noticed people were friendlier.
. netherlands (rotterdam + nijmegen)- long before i visited the netherlands, dutch people were always my favorite fellow travelers for their drunk bike-accident stories and blunt + dark sense of humor. visiting the country just confirmed that the people living there enjoy laughing at themselves just as much as the travelers i met. i left out amsterdam because i felt like dutch people there were a little more closed off to foreigners and (rightfully) sick of dumb tourists for the shit they do
. stockholm- folks can be a little reserved/awkward at first, but nothing a little alcohol doesn’t fix. mostly progressive, friendly and educated folks.
. reykjavik- similar to the swedes, just a little more awkward when sober, and wilder when drunk.
. belgium (brussels + antwerp)- seemed just as cool as scandinavia and the netherlands but didn’t get to spend enough time there to bump it up further notable mentions: * ljubljana- a lot like poland, except more socially progressive. it was a lot more fun the first time around, however, because all the universities were on break during my second visit
* porto- portugal was a fun place in general. i felt the city structure of porto just made it easier to meet people compared to lisbon.
* albania- similar to other places in the balkans, people were exceptionally kind and helped me out when they didn’t have to. i got offered free food everywhere from people who spoke no english! #  favorite cities for nightlife . krakow-  million students in the city and the craziest party city i have been to. enough said
. lisbon- i partied a little too hard here. even the air felt toxic near the end
. stockholm- i have heard it’s different outside of the summer but the party was on  nights a week when i was there during may-june
. belgrade- amazing underground music scene + parties every night. cool dive bars too if you know where to go
. budapest- a lot like krakow. the biggest clubs are bigger but it’s much harder to meet locals here since they seem to have priced them out from the most popular bars notable mentions: * brussels- every single night was wild and the stories involve things i can’t mention on a forum. only city ever where i started a pub crawl and quit halfway to hang out with cool locals i met at a bar
* reykjavik- people just get bat shit crazy here. they are still celebrating not having prohibition half a century after it ended #  favorite places for food (i eat meat) . balkans- serbia, bosnia-herzegovina, macedonia, slovenia, croatia- i’m still having burek withdrawals
. italy- pizzaaaaa
. london- the city seemed to have a little bit of everything and i dig the chicken shops (classy, i know)
. hungary- the local food was bomb (and affordable)
. german kebab shops- i have tried kebabs in dozens of countries and germany wins #  favorite party hostels . the green studio- belgrade- my favorite hostel ever. not a commercial party hostel and the scene depends entirely on the volunteers there at the time. but there were  instances when i had to double book a airbnb after paying for this hostel so i could sleep (staff and guests were partying till  am one time). just look at their top  star review on facebook to get an idea of the shit that happens there
. little havana party hostel- krakow- my favorite big hostel in the world
. the gspot- lisbon- milder version of little havana but the volunteers + guests were the best when i was there for nye 
. the retox--budapest- lived up to the stories. might have been a bit too much for me tbh. probably never staying there again but i’ll surely revisit and do shoeys there again.
. greg and tom party hostel- krakow -smaller and (possibly crazier) version of their rival, little havana. they have the craziest pre-gaming party i have been to in my life. would have gone back there for more wild pub crawls, but my good friends from little havana would have killed me if i “betrayed” them again notable mentions: * the naughty squirrel- riga- pub crawls err night #  favorite chill, social hostels . green studio and lounge- belgrade- i understand the irony of calling this both a chill and a party hostel. but on good nights and the nd time i was in belgrade, this was the chillest place ever.  puppies,  dogs,  cats and volunteers who sing, play the ukulele and drink beer on the sidewalk every night till  am. even if you have no musical talents like me, you can’t help but join in and relax.
. oki doki hostel- warsaw- very cool polish + international staff with a lot of stuff going on around.
. antwerp backpackers- this little hostel was super cozy. the owner even had his own brewery set up right there and we could get some home-brewed beer.
. sunny lake hostel- ohrid- be ready for beach vibes next to a lake and a chill garden to drink in
. hostel one basilica- budapest- this one was half party/half chill but still a great place to meet other social people. notable mentions: * city backpackers- stockholm- the only social hostel in stockholm (i tried  different ones). spent too many nights here but it’s just amazing for meeting other solo travelers. oh and free pasta gets everyone in the kitchen.
* hostel mostel- sofia- there’s a reason it’s so famous
* whole wide world hostel- zagreb- had the perfect combination of guests and volunteers when i was there #  favorite places to meet other solo-travelers . belgrade
. sarajevo
. lisbon
. the baltic route- you will find a lot of people traveling solo through the  capitals of estonia, latvia and lithuania
. romania note: the trick here is really to avoid any super-touristy places that get over-run with american college students on summer-break, and stag or hen parties from the uk. if hostels mostly consist of big groups that are traveling really fast, it changes the vibe for the whole place #  favorite techno/electronic music spots . netherlands -all of it
. belgrade- the drug store (name of a club) has some crazy parties
. krakow- hit up szpitalna  or head to the underground (it’s wayyy in the back) in prozak . for some hard-hitting techno in nd level basement
. stockholm- trädgården and slakthuset are probably my  favorite clubs in the world
. lisbon- there seemed to be a lot going on when i was there. felt like the place for psy-trance lovers notable mention: * zagreb- may be it was my lucky weekend but i had  amazing parties in  nights and the dark techno scene was on point **p.s. i went to berlin before i was into techno. this list would probably change if i went back now** #  favorite historic spots . athens- home to the world’s first democracy\*, and so much more ancient, cool stuff.
. auschwitz- one of the more moving places i have ever been to. ended up going there  times
. rome + florence- the mecca for anyone fascinated with the renaissance and ancient history
. sarajevo- the devastating history of this place hit me harder than i anticipated. the walking tours were pretty intense too because the guides remembered the stories themselves.
. berlin- a place with a lot of important modern history, right up to when the wall fell notable mentions: * paris and munich- hard to skip either if you like history
* tirana- albania doesn’t get much historical recognition but some crazy stuff went down here not too long ago #  favorite spots for nature . iceland- at least  different spots in iceland are among the  prettiest places i have seen in my life
. lake bohinj- slovenian alps- amazing and not a lot of people either if you go early in the summer
. french riviera- broke my budget but the views made it worth it
. transylvania- the name translates to the “land beyond the woods” so you get the picture
. adriatic (croatian/ montenegrin) coast notable mention: * bosnian countryside near sarajevo- really caught me by surprise because of how unexpectedly pretty it was #  favorite picturesque towns/cities . cinque terre, italy- there’s a reason the cruise ships pile up here
. sintra, portugal- looks like something straight out of medieval movie
. dubrovnik ,croatia- king’s landing
. gozo, malta- europe or africa?
. ljubljana, slovenia- that famous architect did a good job notable mentions: * krakow- talk about a romantic city
* tosa de mar (spain)- you have to catch a sunset there. make sure you get the bus times right from barcelona
* brasov- prettiest part of transylvania i visited #  best bang-for-your-buck spots . krakow- you can buy beers for a euro in the city center. bania luka is open till  am
. warsaw- like krakow but slightly less cheap
. sarajevo- just as cheap as krakow but not as cool. still pretty cool though
. belgrade- slightly more expensive than sarajevo. . euro pljeskavicas are must-haves if you eat meat
. budapest- way too cheap for being the former (twin) capital of an empire notable mentions: * porto, lisbon- see some of the coolest places in western europe on a budget
* malta- really pretty and really cheap, and somewhat different from the rest of europe #  awesome places that caught me off guard . slovenia- probably the most underrated country in europe. i’m kinda glad no one is talking about this, so it’s not getting ruined
. christiania- copenhagen- one of the chillest places i have been to yet
. sarajevo- there’s the historic significance of it, and then there’s the natural beauty of the valley
. warsaw- not sure why no one ever told me warsaw people are cool af. it’s also a proper big city with a lot going on
. dresden- little town with a lot of history. do the night tour if you make it there to find out about how the city dealt with the end of communism in very interesting ways notable mentions: * hamburg- cool big city that no one talks about for some reason
* brussels- wasn’t expecting it to be this much fun #  places i haven’t been to that i want to visit some day . bergen, norway
. swiss alps
. southern spain (hopefully after i learn some spanish- the language barrier was real)
. croatian islands
. southern italy #  places i want to go back to the most . greece- my next euro trip will probably just be a month or so in this place so i can fit in all the trips to historical spots that -year-old me wanted to see
. stockholm- never had a bad day there so would not mind going back.
. poland (warsaw + krakow)- some of the friendliest people i have met and the prices don’t hurt
. berlin- only makes sense now that i live for techno
. munich- seemed like a cool city that i definitely didn’t see enough of notable mentions: * ljubljana and slovenia in general
* netherlands- anywhere but amsterdam because dutch people are awesome and the techno is great #  favorite stretches during the trip (in no particular order) * **green studio in belgrade-**\- came across the chillest hostel ever in belgrade with  volunteers ,  guests and a bunch of animals. ended up becoming close friends with the guests and volunteers, and following some of the volunteers on their travels to ada bojana (montenegro), ohrid, skopje and eventually london.p.s - went back again this summer to reconnect with old friends, and of course made some really good new ones too.
* **little havana party hostel in krakow**\- the best large party hostel ever. extended my stay  times the first time i was there and was sad for a week after i left. had to come back to reconnect with the place this summer. the best part about little havana is that if you don’t like the current guests, you can just walk across the street to bania luka and meet awesome polish students to party with
* **new year’s eve  in lisbon with the crew from the g-spot hostel**\- there was a group of  of us (mostly aussies) that met at the hostel and were inseparable for a week around nye. went to my first psy-trance festival ever with these guys
* **world cup finals and semifinals in paris-** i was following the world cup winners around europe and inevitably ended up in paris for the last week. on my first day i met a group of people from a couchsurfing meetup and ended up hanging with them till  am and drinking beers by the canals. that group just got bigger and bigger for the next  nights and culminated in the world cup celebrations
* **felix and the french guys-** i was doing my usual late night head-count to see who wanted to join in my search for the best techno party in zagreb. met these guys chilling outside the hostel and we were in sync immediately. we left the rest of the group and went to a party where the vibe couldn’t have been any better. got back in the morning, and all of us got kicked out of bed a few hours later (we slept past checkout time). after recovering for the day, we ended up going to the same hostel in ljubljana where we raged again for the next  days. we were together for less than a week but really felt like i was part of an old friend group there notable mention: * **traveling with the same people through  cities in the baltics**\- almost everyone in the baltics goes through the same route- estonia, latvia, vilnius, warsaw (and sometimes krakow). there were at least  of us (solo-travelers and groups combined) that kept turning up to the same hostel at the same time in every city. at first accidentally, but after vilnius, we essentially started planning out our hostels together in the next cities. #  (some of the) most interesting stories of the trip * **getting stranded on the albania-kosovo border:** i tried taking an evening bus from tirana to pristina. got booted from the bus and stranded at the kosovo border without any cash (spent it all in albania preparation for a new country), a sim-card or wifi. either the border police or i misunderstood their visa exemption laws. after  mins of failed hitchhiking attempts, found a taxi driver who spoke enough german/english to get me to a nearby tiny albanian town with an atm and cheap-ish hotel for the night. went out to see what’s up in town and found bars populated with depressed -something men and every young person i met tried to sell me weed. a pleasant albanian man from the hotel invited me for a drink, and went on to tell me all about how he just got back the day before from being in a la prison for  months for trying to illegally immigrate with a fake passport. apparently he spent $ on food and ""good california weed"" in prison but couldn't get his hands on booze while there. the next morning, i lost my wallet while looking for a bus to get out of town. had it returned to my hotel with all my cards and id(s) intact by a kind man who found it on the streets (the whole town apparently knew there was a foreigner staying at my hotel). realized  mins before my bus left that the kind man had (probably) taken my  euros in cash from the wallet, so sprinted to an atm to get enough cash for the bus ticket and managed to catch it * **sleeping in a berlin park and waking up in a movie set:** missed a  am bus from berlin to copenhagen because i partied too hard in the evening. after finding out the next bus was  hours later and my hostel (and the hostels around) were fully booked, i snuck into the hostel smoking room to sleep. cleaning stuff woke me up and kicked me out at  am when they found me there. a volunteer told me to try sleeping at a park so went tod do that.  hour into my nap, i woke up to people yelling. i was in the middle of a triangle consisting of two professional cameramen on their big camera-machines facing a couple sitting on a bench. they were filming a movie and the director started yelling “kein photos” when i tried to snapachat it. successfully argued that i should get to record stuff since i was there first, and left * **accidentally going to a bdsm techno party and then running into an old friend:** on a weekend in stockholm, i met  local guys outside a club (trädgården) after it closed at  am. we wanted to keep partying so went to another place, which turned out to be a boat party where cougars go to pick up younger guys. when that closed at  am, a couple outside told us to go with them to a rave in solna (pretty far). we took a taxi there, and on the way, she did mention the word bdsm once or twice but we thought it was a joke. walked into this venue to realize it’s a gay sauna with everyone in leather thongs and dudes walking other dudes on leashes. the  locals were freaking out for a minute but then we collectively decided that we’ll stay till the party ends since we already paid  euros for it. the techno was good so i was making the most of it on the dance floor. noticed someone kept looking at me in the dark as i was dancing around. eventually she came over and was like “what the f are you doing here?”. it was my good friend, frida, who i had met at my hostel in guadalajara last year and partied with a bunch had just flown into stockholm  hours prior to that. after getting over the initial shock, we just kept on partying. * **samoan mma fighter taking down a bouncer in budapest:** it was my first night in budapest in  and i traveled there from slovenia with an american friend i met in cinque terre. we went out with a small group from my hostel. the guy leading was this cheerful kiwi dude who had jokes and was making us drink a lot on the way to the bars (he bought a bottle of jack on the way and almost single handedly finished it in  minutes and made us do swigs). he was built like a samoan tank. he told us he ran mma in new zealand/australia and he definitely looked the part. also mentioned how he is connected with the mafia in budapest. we didn’t really worry because he was very friendly to us. my friend and i forgot his name, so to this day we just refer to him as “the rock”. at the first bar we tried, the bouncer didn’t wanna let us in. the rock got pissed and tried to attack the bouncer and all of us had to restrain him. honestly looked like the bouncer was scared. we went to another bar and he was calm and happy again. many beers later, a couple of us (including the rock) went to the bathroom. some swedish guy said something to my other friend as a joke, and the rock got pissed because apparently the swedish guy disrespected us.  seconds later, he knocked out the swedish dude with one punch. a crowd gathered and a bouncer tried to go after the rock. it was a blur, but in  seconds the bouncer was also almost knocked out. a bunch of bouncers came to help. they surrounded him but everyone was afraid to go in as the rock kept asking them to go for it. eventually the police showed up and broke it up. at that time, my friend and i bailed because we didn’t want to get involved in this shit. * **latvia racist attacks:** riga was an interesting place. a lot of eastern european countries are notorious for having a re-emergence of racist/xenophobic movements. but you don’t usually (or at least i didn’t) encounter any issues when you’re in the fancy touristy parts of these countries. riga was an exception to that rule. all  nights i went out, i encountered problematic people. the st night, i came across some guys who were trying to pick on me at the bar for no reason. i cannot be sure but i suspect it was racially motivated (i’m south asian and somewhat dark-skinned). on the rd night, i came across a drunk group of skin-heads who got pissed because i said cheers in latvian and not russian. but for both of these instances, i had latvian strangers emerge at the scene who had my back. this made sense in the context of what i heard later from a local: that tensions are apparently still high in the country between groups who speak latvian and people of russian heritage who think latvia belongs to russia. the dust doesn’t seem to have quite settled in this post-ussr country. but back to the story. on my nd night night, first i was attacked on the dance floor of a bar by a drunk skinhead. he was pushing me only for seeming to be at that location, so i got free and just went to the other side of the bar (it was huge). an hour or so later, two more drunk skinheads came up to me and told me i need to leave latvia. followed was a conversation of “why?”s that went something along the lines of: them: get out of latvia me: why? them: because you’re black (i’m brown ftr) me: why is that a problem? them: because we are russians. we are nazis me: what does this have to do with being russian? them: we don’t know i was pretty drunk to so i kept asking questions for like  minutes till they themselves were confused as to why they were mad at a tourist helping their economy. eventually one of them just went “you have to leave”, grabbed me and went for a gut punch. he was super drunk, and i had  seconds to brace for it so he didn’t really connect hard (felt like he didn’t want to connect hard for some reason). i stepped back, wished them a good day and walked off looking for any other bar that was open **notable mentions** * every weekend in iceland was wild.  year old me did even dumber stuff than i do now
* spending the nights on the streets of stockholm after losing my friends in the club
* the (more than a dozen) missed buses, and almost missed flights"

Askerman97_returns,cy0mzq,0,1567284302,"slightly awkward question, but how do hostels *usually* respond to this? i've brought back girls on nights out to hotels, and on two occasions, i was not allowed to bring back strangers to my room because my room was not booked for such. but this was hotel, not hostel. for reference, i'll be visiting nyc and will be getting a private room. wonder what people's experiences are regarding this, how do the hostel staff treat these situations, because i imagine this must happen a lot especially after nights out."
elle_ellaria,cy1awv,0,1567287457,i randomly came across a post on here that said that lots of museums in france offer free admission the first sunday of each month. any other tidbits like that worth knowing? particularly things that will save me money! i’m headed to paris for a week then provence the riviera. corsica is also on the list before moving on. i’ll be in france roughly - weeks and planning to get around by train/bus/ferry/car. leaving in a few days.. maybe worth adding it’s my first solo trip 😁
peakrunoff,cy1suk,0,1567289870,"so i'm leaving for europe soon, and i'm a bit stuck. currently my plan is to bring one pair of jeans, one pair of walking shoes for the day, and then maybe a pair of nicer shoes for going out at night? i was thinking these would be boat shoes, simply because they are light and easy to pack. how does this sound? i don't see what other pants i would need bring as jeans are pretty reliable, but also it feels weird bringing one pair. also, should i really be bringing two pairs of shoes? i just want something i can wear but is also good enough for going out at night."

. would i have to pay for parking fees for motorcycles? if so, what countries in particular?
. are there fees i need to pay when crossing borders?

mrichter2,cy3h3x,0,1567298779,"hey! i'm f, from the us, and am in love with the concept of solo travelling. i've done it domestically a few times, with more trips planned for the next few months. i have my first ""solo"" international trip coming up, i'm going to frankfurt in november! however, i'm staying with a family friend while there, and likely will spend a majority of my time with her, so it's really not ""solo"". this was the only way i could convince my helicopter parents to let me go. my parents are great, don't get me wrong. they're just super paranoid and think solo travelling is the worst thing a girl could do. and unfortunately, they still pay for most everything for me (school + housing at school, insurance, gas when i'm at home). i appreciate them and all that they do. but they've made it abundantly clear that i ""can't"" go out of the country on my own. i wanted to do vienna when i found a great deal. they shot that down. then barcelona. and i travel on my own money. i work a lot and save so that i can travel. i just can't really afford to piss them off because like i said, they still do a lot for me. and when i graduate after this year, i'll be back under their roof to save money. which stinks. but that's life. has anyone else been in this situation? i feel confident that i can travel solo and be fine. they're fine with domestic (for the most part), but the minute i mention international, they're like, ""oh go stay with so and so in ____ country so we can know you're safe"" or ""oh, sweden?! you'll be shot!"" or ""no. it's not safe for you to go alone, you can't afford it."" or even ""get a friend to go with you."" but the point is, i want to do it alone! i'm one of the few who likes solitary travel a lot, so i want to go alone. but they don't seem to get that. any advice?! tl;dr : my parents are very helicopter-y. but they can afford to be (?) because they still support me a lot, financially. however, i want to and can afford to travel with my own money. how can i convince them it's safe and i won't die etc?"

positive_nursing,cya4wo,0,1567345662,"i went out to a bar last night with a few girls i met at my hostel. the night was going great! we went to a bar with a downstairs club, a lively atmosphere and dim lighting. two of the girls went to the restroom and i hung out nearby to wait for them. a girl approached me and asked if i would watch her drink while she went in to the restroom herself. i thought nothing of if, said sure, and placed her drink on a counter near me, within eye sight while i continued dancing. little did i know she was out of her mind. she came back from the bathroom after my friends had already returned, and i grabbed her drink and handed it to her. she immediately got in my face and began accusing me of shipping drugs into her drink. i assured her i did not, but she relented. she said she saw me and two other guys each “rub our fingers together above her drink” and now she demands i pay £ for the drink. i said there is no way in hell thats happening. she then demanded i take a drink of her drink to prove it’s not roofied. i initially refused but after  minutes of arguing i said fine and took a big drink. then she was mad about that and said she wouldn’t drink after me. i felt completely lost. i asked her, why would she leave her drink with me, a complete stranger, if she was so concerned with getting roofied. she then stormed off. about  minutes later after laughing off the experience with my friends, security approached me, took me to a back room, told me the girl had said i tried to drug her and they needed to search me. this was fine with me, and after a search and a  minute conversation with security i was allowed to return to my night and friends on the dance floor. the whole situation has sat horribly bitter on my palate. thankfully the security guards were nice and understanding, but the fact that someone could have such a cognitive dissonance and move that to an accusation boggles my mind. it’s not hard to imagine how that could have gone horribly for me and put me in into the back of a police car. all over a nice act. never again will i watch someone’s drink that i do not know. i hate that this situation has hardened me to a degree and left me as suspicious of others as this girl was. really rotten way to end a good night."

so i'll be going on my first solo trip in october to the us, and i wanted to ask for recommendations. i've been wanting to solo travel for about half a year now, and have been lurking this sub since then gaining knowledge and confidence about doing it. so my question is, if you had a week of solo traveling in the states, where would you go? for reference, i am a m from europe who has lived and traveled to the states several times, mainly in the east coast. i would prefer city settings/historical value to wildlife/hiking, and i'm kinda awkward about meeting strangers. any help would be greatly appreciated :) thanks!"

(don’t judge, i’m an elementary school teacher and we need that rest, y’all.) to cut down on the amount of things to watch i would only really plan to take my phone and some cash to the beach, but how do y’all keep those safe if you’re having a solo beach day and want to go in the water? obviously befriending other beach-goers is an option, but i’d love to hear other ideas. i’m very down to buy whatever items have worked for people since security is not an area i want to skimp on. thanks!"

japanyooooo,cydz41,0,1567364314,so i started in japan and eventually ended up in south korea about  days ago. i'm not sure what hit me but i got smacked by a fucking bag of shit and fever and nasty sore throat. day  i didn't get out of bed much. now it's day  now and i'm just starting to feel better. so basically a week has been stripped from my vacation and i can't tell you how upset i would have been had i known this prior to this trip. a fucking week of pto and travel funds gone for this bullshit? i had so much fun the first two weeks perhaps it caught up to me... not sure... maybe just too many nights out. anyway so here i am in seoul wanting to do all of these yours and shit but i feel like ass and can't walk more than a few hundred feet without being completely out of breathe ( i mean i'm not in tip top shape but damn i can run a couple of miles without stopping). so... what do i do? i realize that i'm in the gaming capital of the world and head off to a pc bang. a pc bang is basically a gaming cafe in korea where you can order food and shit and play any games you want. absolute blast honestly. i went to one of the most famous ones which is where the league of legends championship was held this year. (insane stadium). maybe many of you aren't into gaming - but i love it as a side hobby some days after work to play a game of two or something stupid. in the last few days even though i've felt like shit i've just medded myself up and played for  hours plus rather than waste away in the hotel room. i know. i know... the tours would have been better but hey. i made the best of a shitty situation and honestly looking bad i've really enjoyed myself. i know this type of thing doesn't exist anywhere - but next time you're sick in another country.. try to think of things that maybe you could do. obviously if it was extremely bad i would have been bed ridden... but i felt good enough to at least sit up and game . good trip and i wish i had more time to spend in seoul. peace korea

ericflowersss,ckl6fe,0,1564644928,"hello everyone! #xb; i will be traveling to portugal and spain for a couple of days. #xb; afterwards, i will have around  days left to travel. i have provided some cities i was considering visiting with a sample itinerary, and need help deciding what would be the best way to go about making a route. i would love to visit central europe, but i would not mind seeing other cities and countries closer to the region of europe i will be in. #xb; i do not mind using public transportation or flying. for context, i have already been to amsterdam, paris, berlin, prague, and rome in the past. #xb; day  : travel to budapest day : budapest day : budapest day : budapest - vienna day : vienna day : vienna day : vienna - possibly to slovenia? day : from slovenia to croatia day : croatia day : croatia day : croatia. day : croatia to london day : london day :london day : london - home. #xb; my main goals on this trip are to just see as much as i can with the time available, without restricting myself to too much travel. i really want to visit vienna, budapest, and dubrovnik during this trip. but if it's not efficient to ping pong around europe from spain, i don't mind visiting other cities as well. #xb; some other countries/cities i was considering visiting were florence, venice, positano, belgium, copenhagen, sweden, ireland, or london. #xb; for context, i possibly plan on flying home from london. i am also open to suggestions if it's better for me to fly home from a major airport in central europe. #xb; thanks!

SoloTraveler_,ckmxul,0,1564657758,"hey guys, i'm looking for some suggestions on what trip i should do next. i'm looking at the first two weeks of september, probably from the nd to the th. i'll probably be out of a job before the end of the year, so i would prefer to save some money, but right now i have no budget limit. i'm from portugal, so europe based, and that might eliminate some options, like south and central america (unless you can convince me otherwise). while i like some trips to the classic cities, like prague, barcelona, etc, i'm looking at some culture shock. not in the sense of 'look at this poor starving children, i'm so blessed', but more of a cultural, gastronomical sense (for example morocco). landscapes also welcome. would love southeast asia or south america, but i'm afraid i don't have enough time to do a proper visit. so... any ideas?"

Lichewitz,ckpb7h,0,1564670765,"hello, boys and girls from reddit! in this post i will tell you literally everything i experienced while traveling alone to rio de janeiro. although i have traveled solo before, it was always because of work or study, never just for the sake of traveling and experiencing new things. i have an habit of browsing skyscanner in search of interesting prices and i recently found plane tickets to rio de janeiro for an absolutely ridiculous price, so i just bought it and planned my adventure accordingly. all the places i went i found on tripadvisor and i studied the city layout with google maps to figure out how to get everywhere using public transportation whenever possible. oh, and sorry about my bad formatting. ________________________________ **general information:**
_________________________________ **date of travel**: from  july  to  july .  days total.
**city**: rio de janeiro / brazil.
**do you speak portuguese?** yes, but even if you don't, you will get all your shit done without major hassles. but if you take the time to learn some basic words and phrases, it will be greatly appreciated by the locals.
**where did you stay?** at hotel che lagarto ipanema, in the neighbourhood of ipanema (safe and clean), in the south zone of rio de janeiro. i paid  brazilian reais (like  us$) for each day, breakfast included. also, they have free caipirinhas for  minutes every night!!
**what kind of traveler are you?** i'm the kind of person who likes to explore new places, meet new people and find interesting sights and landmarks. i absolutely do not care about nightlife, so i didn't went to lapa or santa teresa in this trip.
**what kind of human being are you?** - i'm a short white male, very light skin (so basically i stand out like a sore thumb in rio de janeiro). _________________________________________ **first day** so, after arriving in the gig airport, i went directly outside and got myself a riocard. if you plan on using public transportation like i did, you absolutely must have one of those. you can use it to pay for buses, metros, vlt, boats, etc. after getting mine, i paid  brl for an airport shuttle that left me in general osorio square, in ipanema (regular buses are like  brl). from there i walked to my hostel, left all my stuff there, changed my clothes into something more comfortable (flip flops, shorts, got my sunscreen on) and my adventure started. this is winter in the southern hemisphere, but do not underestimate how hot rio de janeiro can get, it was more than  degrees celcius most of the days i was there. but there was some kind of fog hovering above the city for the whole period i stayed, some cariocas told me it is normal in winter. [here's what ipanema beach looked like that morning](). those pictures were taken almost at lunch time, if i remember correctly. after that, i ate some pasteis de nata (known in brazil as pasteis de belem), which is some kind of portuguese food, in a little pastry shop in copacabana. after that, i took an extremely cheap uber and went to a place called mureta da urca - it's some kind of sea-side balcony where you can order some super cold beer, sit and watch the sunset with the view of a lot of little boats peacefully resting in the ocean. [here's what the sunset looked like in this spot](). hey, look, it's jesus! i got my beers for  brazilian reais in a place called urca grill. when i went in to pee, i realized they serve brazilian food in a pay-per-weight manner, so i went and made myself this a beautiful dish. i went there a lot of times during my stay, the food was delicious. [here's what my food looked like, price included in brl](). **second day** that day i had two things planned: to explore the lagoa rodrigo de freitas surroundings and to have a very typical carioca lunch in a restaurant called esquimó, in downtown rio. the lagoon (lagoa) was really close to my hostel. if you're planning to go there, please don't be an idiot like me - wear sneakers, not flip flops. flip flops will fuck you up, specially if you try to explore the catacumba park, which has some pretty nice views of the lagoa. the lagoa itself was a really cool place to walk, run, walk your dog or your kids, and maybe have a picnic on the least weird-smelling areas. some specific points of the lake were really smelly, but it was mostly alright. [here are some photos of the lagoa. unfortunately, the visibility wasn't that great due to the fog i mentioned earlier](). hey, look, it's jesus again! i think the perimeter of the whole thing is like  km. i walked around it twice and then i rented a bike for  brl per hour and went around it a few times by bike, it was really fun, the weather was very nice (there are cheaper alternatives for renting a bike but those involve an app of a local brazilian bank, so i didn't really bother). then i took the metro and i went to have lunch at the esquimó restaurant. that place is the tits. you pay  brl and choose one kind of meat, four things to go with it (i decided to go full on brazilian and asked for rice, beans, broccoli and guava flour). they also bring you a drink of your choice and a little pudding as dessert. all that for  reais, no questions asked. you ask for your meal, and twenty seconds later (seriously), i mountain of food appears before you. rio is truly a magical place. the food was delicious, and it was way too generous, there wasn't any room left for the dessert when i finished. the drink (a yerba mate tea) was served in a tiny glass and i honstly drank it hoping it wouldn't kill me with diarrhea later. it didn't, it was all good. [here's my esquimó lunch](). after that, i went and sit on a bench outside the restaurant for like  minutes because i couldn't even walk after all that food. it was glorious. after that, i went back to my hostel, changed and went to ipanema beach again. it was a good day. (the food at urca grill is much better, by the way, but i went to esquimó because i was told it was a classic brazilian restaurant in rio). **third day** in the morning, i walked from ipanema to the end of leblon, to the two brothers mountain (morro dois irmãos in portuguese). it's a place you can climb by foot, lots of shades from the trees and beautiful nature. i thought it was going to feel dangerous and shady, but it absolutely didn't, and i wasn't the only one up there, i saw and talked to several people on the way, most of them also tourists. the views were amazing, [as you can see here.]() after that, i went to see christ the redeemer. you can't go to rio de janeiro without climbing the corcovado mountain and getting real close to the son of the original g, right? so there i went. i bought tickets for the christ the redeemer on the internet. there are three ways you can visit the monument: by walking (you have to be seriously in shape for this, and probably use a lot of insect repellent), by minivans that pick you up in some specific spots of rio, or by the little train. i chose the train because there wasn't space on the vans anymore (the price it's  brl for both the train or the minivans, and if you decide to walk, you have to pay  brl). the train ride was cool enough, but mostly uneventful. it has some beautiful views occasionally. if you go by train, sit facing opposite of the train's direction for a better view, and when coming down, sit as you normally would. once up there, you get an amazing view of the whole city. i went there at  pm and stayed until the sunset. i had a beer up there and bought a little mug, because hey, i'm a tourist. it's a bit crowded up there, obviously, but with a little bit of patience, you can take your selfie with jesus and take some really beautiful pictures of the whole city from up there (and you can see niteroi from there, too). beers are not too expensive up there, the souvenirs are. [here are some of the photos i took up there.]() **fourth and fifth day** on the fourth day, i went to walk at the lagoa again, then i walked the whole ipanema beach one more time. i had one of the sweetest moments of my trip in the beach, that morning: some guys started playing some really nice bossa-nova right in front of the tom jobim statue. three guys playing jazzy relaxing music, the ocean right there behind them, making that soothing sound... jeez, i think i shed a tear or two. i filmed them but unfortunately, the audio is kinda messed up, so i won't post it. after that, i had lunch (urca grill again) and then i went to a place called marina da glória, which is a pier with a lot of boats that you can book rides on (in advance, of course). i made a reservation via tripadvisor on a tour called ""open sunset sailing tour"" for  brl. guys. that was the most amazing part of my trip. the boat ride had free caipirinhas, snacks and the guides were very knowledgeable and spoke good english. we took a  hour long boat trip around rio region, starting with the guanabara bay, then going near the sugar loaf (which i didn't climb, maybe next time), then we stopped near a quiet beach for diving and waiting for the sun to set. the views were spectacular, it was one of the greatest things i've done in my life. worth every penny. if you get the chance to do it, do it, it's unbelieavable. the weather was great, too. [here are the photos of my last two days in rio.]() _____________________________________________ **final remarks** the first thing i'd like to say is: the cariocas are the coolest people on the planet. never before i felt so welcomed anywhere as i did there. if you can speak a little portuguese you will feel like a superstar, everybody will want to talk to you (uber drivers, people at the hostels, people you meet around). i spent an hour talking to the room maid of my hostel while i rested in the last day, also at lot of people everywhere just started random, happy conversations with me. i'm not usually the kind of person who likes to talk to random people in the street, but i truly feel like rio kinda changed that a bit. holy shit, the people are so happy! they give off this amazing energy, it's unbelieavable. secondly, i'm really glad i did this, and i want to thank you guys all for the inspiration for planning and going on a solo trip. it was an incredible experience! another important thing: although i mostly stayed in the south zone, which is generally regarded as safe, i felt safe everywhere, including centro and when taking the metro back from glória to ipanema, by night. also, i used metro a lot and i also took a bus in the largo do machado region, and i never felt unsafe. but of course, always mind your surroundings. if you are there, try to have some legitimate brazilian food. i mostly ate at urca grill, which is cheap, delicious and if the sunset is coming, you might as well just grab a beer and sit on the balcony outside to wait for it. of all the places i went, this is the first time that i actually didn't want to ever leave. i will miss you, rio de janeiro."

hfhhgmarshmallows,ckuafy,0,1564693387,"im f and i've been solo travelling for almost  years and i finally feel like i'm 'done' solo travelling. over the years i've been on countless backpacking trips, studied abroad, volunteered, and have spent approximately  years living and working as an expat in  countries. this summer i walked the camino de santiago and now a 'normal' backpacking trip feels so empty and shallow in comparison. i'm not sure if it's just travel burnout talking, but i really feel like solo travel has stopped benefiting my life. when i first started solo travelling it gave me so much confidence and a zest for life but now i don't really feel anything. getting on a plane to a foreign country or talking to strangers in a hostel doesn't feel that much different to going to my local supermarket to buy a pint of milk. i arrived in a new country yesterday and i really couldnt care less and dont feel excited at all. my life at home is good so i don't feel the same need to escape from my problems. i think most of my future trips will be travelling with friends. i'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this?"

(start: kocapri savici - . night: zasavska koca - . night: trzaska kocana dolicu - . night: pogacnikovdom - end: vrsic pass)
i was thinking about getting a hikingbuddy, but i don't know if i will find someone in the short time before i want to go and i would rather do it alone when i'm being honest. i'm fit, motivated and have the right gear. i heard it's an easy mountain as 'every slovene should climb it once in their lifetime' and many people are even seen with sandales. plus it's pretty crowded so i was wondering if i would ever be alone anyways?
so my question is, on the route i chose, can i do it alone or would that be suicide? if so, where could i find someone who is willing to join me in the adventure? bonus question: does someone know how i get from bovec to the startpoint and from the endpoint back to bovec? (i will have a car if that helps) thanks for reading, i appreciate every advice!"

(the flights were only slightly more expensive than oman (but the visa was cheaper haha) and i recently learned to drive so maybe i'd do oman when i'm more confident behind the wheel) i've been looking at lebanon itineraries and have found that every place is fairly close and accessible. i'm going for \~ days and intend to see beirut, jeita grotto, baalbek, byblos, tyre, qadisha valley and maybe even tripoli (undecided on the last one) so, my question: **is it better to stay in beirut and just take day trips to these places since everything is at most  hours away or should i actually move about in terms of accommodation?** (say from lebanon to tyre and do southern day trips, or lebanon to tripoli and do north day trips?) i've done about \~ countries solo but i'm a little scared going to lebanon because of the region's social/political turbulence. i read that beirut is the most developed tourism wise while other places have fewer (but cheaper) options so wandering about by myself in cities with less of a tourist/hospitality network if that puts me at risk is also something i'm considering while making this decision. would love to learn from your experiences, and thanks so much again, this sub is so helpful =)"

[this blog post]() suggests that there are no official avenues for this purpose, and that i will just have to book something, though the post is from back in a october. i'm having trouble finding an answer to this. further, if i cannot obtain a negative test after quarantining (some people test positive long after their contagious period is over), how do i go about getting cleared by a doctor? does costa rica have the equivalent of ""urgent-care"" facilities that the us does? thanks!"

rapture322,q26cqa,1,1633470235,"hello all! first time poster so sorry if i make any mistakes. i recently got some time off and have always wanted to travel to the state of vermont. i'm a big hiker and love the outdoors, as well as very interested in museums/ historical sights. i was wondering what some of your recommendations would be. i'll be making the trip solo and am looking for some decent places to see/eat/ and stay at that wont break the bank. i plan to be there for about  days and will be driving/ have my vehicle. edit: typos"
snailderail,q2fcho,1,1633504766,"my brothers were backpacking and needed a driver to get them into an area and pick them up (that was my job). i realized quickly how expensive the aspen area was but i was able to enjoy myself on a shoestring budget: first, bathrooms: i checked out where primo bathroom areas were located, like outdoor malls and villages, groceries, even port-a-potty options and found out a wide range of them. most places closed at pm, so be prepared. some places also offered showers for the outdoor folks that are travelling through. second, visitor centers: aspen hires golden staff to help you with the towns and events. i realized aspen had a huge history of mining, the arts and prehistoric fossils. i was able to listen to a philharmonic concert for free, an organ concert for free, panned for gold in nearby creeks, day hiked to fossil sites, window shop the expensive plazas and get some great photos along the way while finding local eateries as i explored the city. third, car camp: i was shocked to see the a good group of the low-wage, low-income staff that catered to us at these expensive malls and villages actually slept and lived out of their cars in the parking lots. i asked about this to staff members and it's allowed, as long as you're not disturbing others and keeping to yourself. many of the staff are ski bums who love the weather and live a shoestring, part-time job lifestyle. many also had dogs and access to electricity. they were living good. for me, i used my truck, i brought along two pillows, a towel for the floorboard, a blanket and a face cover to block out any light (many parking lots have bright lights and when the sun rises, it can be harsh coming through the glass). i set the towel below my feet to keep my toes from getting dirty from the floorboard, i put one pillow on my lap while another behind my head, and wrapped myself in a blanket. if you park near a coffee shop you can get wifi but many places around the city had regular cell towers so service wasn't an issue. you can basically park anywhere, including the forest, but parking near villages helps kept the jitters at bay and you never know when you need to use the restroom... i also put my sun shade up for privacy and i backed in to parking spots so i can easily leave. no police came by, no security teams checked on me. third, food from grocers: don't waste your money on restaurants, instead get your food from marketplaces. they'll have premade meals and all your needs fairly cheap compared to restaurants. just keep an eye on your intake, some food is unsettling and if it hits you in the middle of the night, you may be stuck looking for a restroom. fourth, nobody knows you: i realized thousands of people came and went through this town daily, so the best way to blend in, don't wear fancy clothes, wear casual, dress waaay down and blend in with the locals. not making myself look like a tourist really let the guard down on many locals i chatted with, including great hole in the wall eateries and free events. be kind, be nice and let the locals talk. more importantly, be a good listener. you're the visitor and that's their home. explore respectfully. i had a real blast and i spent less than $ total and i really spoiled myself with a few restaurants and access to some museums. had i got a hotel, it would have destroyed my budget. i looked at it this way: however much money i spent i subtracted that from $ per night to determine my savings. all together, four nights x $ is $ - $ spent total = $ saved. not bad! my brothers came back safely and i was able to give them the grand tour of what i discovered. what an awesome way to end the hike. #xb; tips: go to the visitor centers. check out hours of operations for any establishments. be nice to the locals. enjoy the outdoors! #xb; thanks for reading."

emcro,q4nfmz,1,1633792979,"hi all, i'm the indie developer of the [cardpointers app]() which i shared with this awesome sub about . years ago, and i thought i'd share an update as i've added a lot of new features with ya'll in mind in the latest version. if you don't yet use the app, here's a quick summary: * maximize the points and cash back on everyday spend just by using the right card -- add your cards by name (no bank logins) and the app will sort all of your cards based on their bonus multipliers across  different categories, and hundreds of subcategories. over , cards and  different banks are supported in the u.s., canada, uk, and many other countries.
* track all of the recurring monthly/annual credits that a lot of credit cards have these days.
* add and track amex, chase, and other offers, so you'll never let a good one expire again thanks to automatic reminders and integration throughout the app and maximize your savings.
* apple is currently featuring the app in the **great apps for ios ** and **must-have safari extensions** lists (i'm still pinching myself for that, feels surreal!) #xb; and here's what's been added in the latest version: * **safari extension**: automatically show you which of your cards you should use on ,s of e-commerce sites while you shop to maximize your category rewards and any offers you have available.
* **safari extension** superpower: activate and sync every amex and chase offer at once (no more tapping  times to add all the amex offers!) and they'll show up immediately in the app, and the shopping part of the extension mentioned above.
* **location reminders**: save the location of your favorite stores, then the app will automatically notify you when you're next there, with the details of your best card.
* **smart lists**: set up search criteria and be notified as soon as new offers become available on amex, chase, citi, and bank of america, so that you can add them to your card before anyone else.
* **every region in the world is now supported**, with hundreds of new cards added to the most-requested countries: canada, uk, and australia. if your card is missing, you can now add a new card right in the app and customize it fully.
* rewrite of the apple watch app which now supports swipe actions throughout, independent location reminders, full offer details (and snoozing), and lots more. #xb; if you're not an apple user, there are still some new goodies for you: * standalone version of the extension which allows you to bulk-add and sync your amex offers and is % free called cardpointers x and available from the [chrome store](). more of the safari extension features will be integrated into the chrome version in the next month.
* my next big focus for  is wrapping up the new native android version of the app, you can [sign up for the official waitlist]() and be the first to know about it when it's ready. in the meantime i continue to support the original version of the app as a [pwa]() which is % free for all users and is built with material design and looks works great on android and has the card recommendation feature. #xb; everything i do is built privacy-first: * financial, browser, and location data are the most private imaginable, and my focus has always been to put your privacy and security first. there is \*no\* browser history or location data that ever leaves your device, everything is processed within the app/extension itself.
* i do not collect any financial data, and especially not any bank logins, as no app actually needs it to help you earn more from your cards. #xb; the app is a free download, and every feature from the original version of the app continues to be % free, for new and existing users. some of the new features are only available to pro members available via in-app purchase. i'd love to have you check out the app and get your feedback, speaking with users has helped shape the app to what it is today, and i'm all about helping everyone maximize the many opportunities to save money and earn more points by leveraging their credit cards' benefits. #xb; website: []() chrome extension: []() app store: []()"

KresblainTheMagician,pccrb1,1,1630026004,"i am planning a surprise vacation for my wife for next january to uvita, costa rica. here are the details so far: **arrival** we arrive in san jose, costa rica at pm i was looking at renting a car from sixt since they seemed pretty trustworthy, but the latest i can schedule a pick-up after hours would be :pm and i am not sure if that is enough time to off-board, pickup luggage, and get to the companies location for pick-up despite them being located in the airport (from what google tells me anyways). since we arrive so late, i plan on staying the night in san jose at any hotel i can find that's close/cheap (this is not my priority atm) on day  (the day after arrival) we will leave that morning and drive down the coast to our airbnb in uvita stopping at towns along the way; this looks to be roughly a - hour long drive which is fine. days - will be spent on day trips exploring/relaxing at our airbnb. **departure** our flight leaves san jose at am on day , so i will only be booking the airbnb until day , checking out at am and driving up to san jose again and spending a few hours there killing time before heading to the airport to return our car and get checked-in for the flight. #xb; my main concerns right now are the arrival/departure plans i have, not sure if they are the best option and really need some input or opinions from others on this. for the car rental if i don't think i can make the pick-up time that night i will just get a taxi/uber/shuttle? to the airport the next day and pick-up then. we can still leave early enough to make stops along the coast on our way to uvita. i am also unsure if my check-out/departure plans are solid. i don't want to stop at any point along the way from uvita to san jose since traffic may cause issues, but this leaves us with hours to kill before we should arrive at the airport. i am also concerned about recent covid- spreading and did not see any negative test required for entering or leaving costa rica. i would love some clarity on that as well so i can plan accordingly."

ScareCrow1405,opq0a6,1,1626997194,"i am an m and have dreamed about traveling through europe for years now. i have about a month and a half before going off to college. i have planned an itinerary for about a -day trip (trains to get around and hostels to stay) and have saved enough money to do so. i currently don't have any friends with money and/or interest in going, so i thought of going solo. i do have concerns for safety, especially in major cities like paris, that i might get mugged, hurt, or have documents stolen. i understand sly pickpocketing is huge, but i've got some plans to curb that. obviously, the mere thought terrified my parents, who immediately opposed the trip. ""you are gonna get stabbed and have your passport stolen"" as a first-time backpacker, i would like to know some unbiased opinions on this. is it really that bad? is going at this age alone not advisable? what are some realistic chances i will run into issues? context about me:
fully vaccinated and currently, i am in the usa (little to no travel restrictions)
i have traveled to places like johannesburg and santiago, but always with friends and family. i grew up in sao paulo, brazil, so i feel like compared to a lot of my american friends i am pretty qualified when it comes to street smarts (by no means do i mean that condescendingly, but i am trying to contextualize this post). any advice would do! and if you got this far, thanks for reading."

Grijns_Official,orxpsp,1,1627302638,"stockholm is a crazy expensive place to travel to for us backpackers. here’s some things i picked up on to make it a little more affordable. -transport
transport is actually not that. expensive compared to everything else, the  main tips i have are get the sl app. where you can get your tickets for  minutes. but while you are in the city i would really recommend the scooters placed throughout the city especially lime. you can get a day pass for kr ( euro) which means you can go anywhere in the center where your heart desires! it might not be for everyone but especially us younger folk will enjoy these fun scooter rides in a city that is completely adapted to this form of transportation. -stay hostels are actually not as expansive as you might think compared to the food and other stuff you will pay for on your trip a hostel night. i got it down to kr per night but here’s the kicker. there’s a hostel called stf af chapman. look it up! it’s a crazy stay for the money. i payed about kr per night and it really is worth it. you will be sleeping in the city center on an old decommissioned military ship! just the experience alone is worth the money! -food
food is where stockholm gets really scary. if you eat at restaurants expect to pay kr on food every day! kebab places are cheap(er) and getting a loaf of bread is probably not a bad idea from the coop supermarket. here’s a dumb tip for food: go to ikea!! their kitchen is amazingly priced and also a fun experience to visit ikea while in sweden. the oldest and biggest one is situated outside stockholm a little to the south and you can go there with a free busride. so technically the cheapest way to survive foodwise is take the free  min bus to ikea every day and eat there delicious meatballs for about kr! sweden will never be a cheap place to visit but there are ways to make it a little easier on your wallet. take care! ~me from stockholm🇸🇪"

* save, react to, and give kudos to other itineraries
* social feed to connect with like-minded travelers, ask questions, form groups and get advice - message and follow users too.
* fun community experience with points, coins, badges, rewards, reputation scores to encourage folks to post their itineraries, for now, we are giving away amazon gift cards for each itinerary that's shared. firstly, i wanted to share here because hopefully it's of interest to folks planning their trips. secondly, very open to feedback and ways we can improve / other features you would like to see. feel free to email me directly ([]()) or share your feedback below. hope everyone is staying safe! thanks!"

- i’m not a fan of resorts, but i’m interested in boutique hotel recs, airbnb’s or house rentals that have decent amenities. - cool explorations or finds. for example tours of a rum distillery, visiting ruins, that sort of thing. guided is best, but im down to chat up locals and get the scoop. pluses but not dealbreakers:
- good spa, healing or hot spring type locations"

bbjimin,mx8ed8,1,1619222413,"**quick preface:** no, i'm not *exactly* on a ""shoestring"" budget but i would like to keep things very cheap except in situations where you're paying a little bit extra for a big return in comfort or convenience. example being if a hostel is $ and an airbnb is $, i'd probably just pay the extra $ for the airbnb. if the hostel is $ and the airbnb is $ i'm definitely choosing the hostel. i have very high hopes of solo travelling next year starting early . i haven't fully decided exactly what my route is going to be or how long i'm going (very dependent on whether or not i decide to take advantage of the working holiday visa or if that even works out) but i'm hoping for at least  months in europe/asia. my budget will hopefully be around $k cad/k usd. i don't intend on going on extreme budget but i'd definitely like the trip to be quite long and won't be spending frivolously or spending my entire trip in airbnbs. also i know a lot of this can be answered with google but i find personal responses to be a lot more helpful. **luggage** **a**. what bag(s) do you recommend? i've seen solo travelers with these massive backpacks on and i imagine i'll have to do the same as i probably won't be spending a super long time in any given city (though there are definitely cities i plan on booking a - week airbnb in to emulate ""living"" there if the price is right and my initial impression is good.) **b.** how do you take a huge bag on an airplane? maybe i'm slightly overestimating the size, but wouldn't a bag you're literally living out of typically be too big for a carry on and therefore be a checked bag? i've only been on a few flights and i've already had a checked bag lost once, i feel like that would be a very stressful experience especially when i'd likely be on so many different flights. i feel like having a normal backpack would make sense to have your important stuff in but then you're carrying around two bags. **hostels** **a.** how do hostels actually work? this is somewhat tied in with the first question because i have no idea if you can book a bed/room at a hostel for several days and whether or not there's adequate storage (or any locked storage at all) so that you can leave your big backpack or most of your stuff back at the hostel. basically i have a lot of backpack questions lol. **b.** what are hostels even like? for some reason i imagine them as not-the-nicest living quarters with several beds per room but maybe that's just driven by their super low cost and being popular for those on a very tight budget (my budget is nothing insane but i'm not going to go as cheap as humanly possible on my first big trip) **c.** how much do hostels typically cost? from what i've seen it obviously varies heavily based on city (and i've heard some hostels are even more expensive than airbnb/hotel) but what do they typically cost in a big city vs i guess a medium popularity city? i just looked prices up in a few cities and they actually seem very expensive in bigger cities (like $-usd+ which seems insane for a shared room) **d.** do hostels typically have laundry rooms or do you need to use a local laundromat usually? **costs** **a.** how much would you say you spend per month on average? obviously staying in paris for a month will be much more expensive than somewhere in say romania but i'm mostly looking for averages as i'd like to see a lot of europe/asia. i'm hoping to save around k cad/k usd for the entire trip so while i'm not going extreme budget i would like to make it last quite long rather than spending .k a month. **c.** i've seen a lot of people say to ship souvenirs home rather than lug them around but what's the most cost effective way of doing this? shipping is super expensive so i can't imagine sending things from eu to canada to be very cheap especially if it's a semi regular thing. i don't plan on buying an extreme amount of stuff but probably a couple things here and there. i'd rather spend my money living in europe rather than sending things home to make me sad when i return to canada lol. **tips and tricks?** based on your experience, what are some things that have really made a big difference for you when travelling whether it be a specific piece of tech, saving money or just a strategy for organizing your bag or something that made your life easier?"
wasporchidlouixse,mxeqrt,1,1619248180,"for me it was dubrovnik; i was just using it as a stopover on my journey to montenegro and had no idea how tourist friendly it would be. very idyllic at night when the streets of old town are quiet. i also had no expectations for madrid as my sights were set on barcelona, but was very nicely surprised and fell in love with it."
katethetravellingbug,mxgmef,1,1619256981,"crazy place to start but this was my first stop where my latest travelling experience took place !! new york is very popular , busy , the city that never sleeps but it’s sooooo worth the trip , so many iconic scenes - you literally walk around saying - seen this and seen that - it’s in so and so film !! we first arrived on the th august  in  odd degree hit wandering the streets trying to find the bus terminal for ages ! ( we were like pretty much right next to it on multiple occasions) heat obviously got to us , plus the rare sight well maybe not in *new york* but from where i’m from of  guys just shooting up on the street ..! first quote of the trip , a guy seeing us looking shocked said - get used to it !!! buses are really easy to use and gets you to the jersey side for like $ a time !! watch out for morning commuters and heading back out of the city around pm- pm ! the queues are something else !! we travelled all the way down to *miami* on *amtrak* which is a great way to travel *america* - quick, easy and comfortable ( when the air con works!!) we also stayed in air b n b ‘s - don’t rate these enough - we had some amazing stays including new york - our host marlon, we will be forever grateful for , as a gift took us to see the skyline at night from the *new jersey* side
![]() what an amazing sight ... photographs will never do it justice there is too much to see in new york !!! the main ones being **times square**
an absolute must , to sit on the steps and just watch the comings and goings - the crazy street entertainment, the sheer amount of yellow cabs tour buses and people is truly unbelievable ![]() ![]() **the empire state**
climbing the stairs( or lift ) you’ll embark on the journey of ‘the making of the building’ - its very interesting full of facts and makes you want to run to the top !! when you reach the top it’s just wow!! all the iconic scenes , buildings and the view is just surreal !!! busy - always ! but you’ll get some stunning photos and it’s another tick of the list of things that need to be done in *new york*
![]() ![]() ![]() **statue of lib**
right unless you’ve booked millions of months in advanced to go walk round the top ... it’s a little pointless going right over to the island - ellis it’s called !!! it’s lovely to see the views from that side of the river ... it’s great to see the status up close but from my experience it’s costs more to go onto the island and as much as it’s an amazing sight after all the angles and selfies ( especially first time round i went on my own) not too much else to be done !! but take the ferry on your hop on hop off bus ticket and get the really good tour guide !! your winning !! so much information was given to us on the way there and back! the ferry pretty much stops as well so you can take lots of photos and get it all in one frame as it is massive !!! such an iconic must see tho !!! **ground zero/fountains**
the world famous twin towers disaster that happened in  pays tribute to those loved ones that lost they lives through a very eary set of fountains and gardens with every single named engraved around the outside. they are absolutely stunning and just surreal how big and far they go down ... *rip / victims* the world trade center is now built that replaced them and also they is museums to teach you all that happened ![]() ![]() **central park**
where do i begin... it’s actually mental how beautiful this park could be set in the most famous city ever !!!! it’s just huge !!! we saw about a quarter of it !!!! including a tea room - cute but awful toilets ... turtle lake which was pretty cute and many little paths , rocks and the biggest lake in the middle !!! just surreal and the first time i visited i even saw a racoon! incredible !! did have the elf scene in my head and thought he was literally going to jump on my face !!!
it’s just magical , laying on the grass soaking up the sun or playing a game with friends whilst looking up at the stunning blue skies and buildings ... unbelievable really that in the middle of the city that never sleeps you find a park like this ...
![]() ![]() ![]() **broadway**
where do i start !!! i love a musical and i’ve seen  on broadway - everyone likes a sing along !! it’s how we got there which is funny !! we were still on the hop on hop off bus at .pm when the show starts at !! we ended up getting off and basically running to times square when you can get cheaper tickets !!! out of breath we finally got there and asked the salers if they had any tickets for *pretty woman* - the guy speaking to us said i don’t think i do ... but then another guy turned round and said what did you want to see ... and we still panicking a little bit ! he said yes actually  dollars each and with awesome seats !! we grabbed them and started running we had  minutes !!! we also had to figure out where the theatre was !! we ran in sat down and had  minutes to spare ! so worth it - basically go see a broadway !! ![]()
![]() **grand central**
what an iconic stunning building - it’s a must when visiting new york .. just to say you’ve seen it and stood on the steps that sooooo many actors and actresses stood it !!! ![]() ![]() hop on - hop off bus ! i think is the best way to travel round new york - so many routes and so easy to navigate ( you get a map or the app) you grab a set of headphones 🎧 and you are set to learn everything you need to know about the big apple 🍏 but be aware they will try rip you off ... don’t just accept the first price - they will always go down! i’ve just given you my top places to see but also they is - brooklyn bridge - wall street - sakura park - rockefeller’s - shopping 🛍!!! ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() this is the one where we got wet !! ![]() when it rains in new york it really rains !!!! that brings me to the end of our  days in new york ! hope you enjoyed reading about my experience and can take some tips for your trip :) stay tuned for the next part of our trip -washington dc"

HiImAlexXD,n3tfbe,1,1620040244,"if you’ve seen the movie, the way, you know it’s about the km pilgrimage called el camino de santiago in northern spain. if you’ve not seen it, it’s worth watching. in light of the coronavirus, i’m wondering if there is a similar walk here in the united states? the camino started centuries ago as pilgrims from all over europe would come to the shrine dedicated to st. james at santiago de compostela. i am not looking to do a religious pilgrimage, but like the idea of walking from town to town, through countryside, mountains, cities if necessary. i will walk. i will carry minimal supplies. does anyone have any suggestions? thanks! additional info after reading these first responses to my post.... thanks so much for the helpful feedback. i turned  this year and just a few years ago did quite a bit of weekend backpacking mostly in north carolina. while i used to entertain thoughts of hiking the at, pct, john muir, etc., tackling one of these wilderness trails (in its entirety) is no longer on my to-do list. i admire those who do (and know a few who did) but that much of a wilderness challenge is not for me. the camino may be something i can do once this highly infectious disease is subdued. considering the close quarters pilgrims and others who walk the camino shelter in, it may be a while before that happens. why the camino? while the camino is specifically a pilgrimage for many, indeed if not for most, there are some who walk for other reasons. for me i see the camino as a physical and mental challenge, (hopefully) a doable one. i love to walk and from what i’ve seen, why not walk - calmly, peacefully - through some of the most beautiful countrysides. while i don’t see this as a pilgrimage personally, i do think i’ll experience some kind of transformation by walking along this “trail” so many others from so many other times and countries have done before me. but if i don’t, that’s ok. i expect that the comradery, drinking local wines, eating local foods and meeting locals and those from other countries will be well worth the effort. so when i think about walking in the us, i know nothing exactly like the camino exists here in the us, but wonder if there are walks here that incorporate some of what is available on the camino. maybe there’s something regional like the chimayo in nm - thanks for that suggestion. i just found out about a trail called the american discovery trail. my research continues. thanks again!"

rakahr11,mkm1d8,1,1617633089,"if i think about my travels i must say, that i was a little judgy in the very beginning of them. i compared backpacking with all-in resort packages, actual backpack carrying with trolley rollers and hotel bookings with family run cozy guesthouses. i learned that everyone travels differently and that i shouldn't judge the way people travel. there is no 'one real way' but simply preferences. sometimes it depends on the available budget, the age or even just the place you visit. what i am proud though is the personal change i went through during my very first year and a half exploring south and east asia. i went with basically no luggage (kg), just a handbag with some underwear, a second shirt and the clothes i had on. i promised myself only to buy what i would need and ended up having only kg of luggage at all times. it was very comfortable to live the minimalistic life, though it only works in rather hot climates, i suppose. i also learned that sometimes, the slightly more expensive option has a better value than the cheapest. it is nice to avoid a bed bug situation or having an actual lock on the door. i felt that the 'little things' slowly eat up silently a budget. the night out in a beach shack, hygiene products from western brands, the not-thought-through impulsive itinerary or a fixed mindset about certain places that are a 'must' to visit. i also needed to learn, that while eating out is great, especially in certain countries, a place with the possibility to cook might just be the more convenient option. with this said, one thing that has kind of been implemented in my had is the question: ""do i really need/want that?"" it can be a bit tiring to also question. i feel that the  weeks splurge vacation with the 'i don't care attitude' might be a nice thing to do once in a while. especially with long term travel, having a vacation from your travels sometimes just gives you back that energy. just the feeling of being save in a place you know your way around is very relieving. how about you? what shoestring travel story made you proud of yourself? what have you learned by conveniently travelling at a low cost?"

(museum of anthropology) lucha libre - mexican wrestling - arena mexico - i’ve always sat in the first or second row - they will literally fight in the stands right next to you - it’s like wwe on steroids - buy your tickets during the day from the actual box office. frida khalo house - the neighborhood and local market is nice too xhochimilco - boat rides through the rivers (island of the dolls is another option here) great for groups or a couple - some will have + - it’s quiet during the week or a big party place on the weekends.. music, food, entertainment as you’re pushed along on a big bright colorful boat. don’t forget to check out the axolotls as i think this is the last place in the world where they exist. teotihuacan pyramids - you can take the public bus from the north part of the city or hire a private car/bus. can’t miss. a few other smaller must sees: sears department store coffee shop (tea and pastries as well) th floor - hidden gem - outdoor seating area with an amazing view of palacio de bellas artes. el morro - legendary local place - -+ locations - hot chocolate and churros - often an hour wait just to get a table the food! amazing food, amazing food, amazing food! this can’t be said enough.. tacos tacos tacos if you like mexican food - you won’t want to leave. i’m pretty well traveled at around + countries; and mexico city is my favorite city in the world. if you’re looking for a place to go on more of a budget check it out, it may just work for you. watch a few top  videos on youtube and get a feel for it. r/mexicocity is also a great sub for more info and itinerary suggestions i’m just trying to spread the word to others here on reddit as they did for me. if you’ve been here please comment let us know about your thoughts, itinerary suggestions and experiences. and like i said i'm headed back there this weekend so if you have any suggestions that i missed or not the typical things to do, please let me know!?"

put-the-whammy-on-em,lpa7pd,1,1613952180,"hey, all! i’m a  year old solo female heading out in may for a great american adventure until next january — before i start at university and settle down into my boring old life again. i am an author and i work independently(: i have a budget of about  a month for transport, housing, food, expenses. i planned to spend a couple weeks in each state on my tentative itinerary, with an emphasis on hiking sightseeing. i am required to return home every - weeks for a doctor’s appointment, but this isn’t a huge deal. initially, i wanted to use the cheapest airbnbs available, usually aiming for less than  bucks a day. this totals to about  for a couple weeks or - for the month — including service cleaning fees. but they disappear quickly, some hosts are flakey, and the cheapest airbnbs seem... very inaccessible or strange. without a car, i still need to be able to get groceries leave the immediate vicinity of the home, but the cheapest private rooms tend to be on a road flung out in the middle of nowhere. as a solo female, i’m not comfortable couchsurfing. it’s not only important that i’m safe, but i also need consistent wifi to complete my work and some private space. i considered hostels, but the united states doesn’t really have hostels, unfortunately. the ones here are wildly overpriced for an unsafe bunkbed in a moldy old house — so that’s out of the question:( recently, i’ve considered conversion vans. i live in florida and it would take a hot minute to get to the other coast and back, but i have the time. i could take my time at each rural destination and stealth park in cities. i want to hit as many national parks as possible and hike for hours, so an rv seems like a much more suitable choice for this. if properly outfitted, i could have internet access and an outlet — or i could drive to a starbucks and find wifi for free. i like the freedom granted from a van but my insurance rates will be high and gas costs need to be factored in. i’ve worked out the math and, moving slowly, i’m guessing it wouldn’t be much less than airbnbs... the only benefit is that transportation is dealt with, housing is stable, i feel safer, i own the van at the end of the day. currently, i could only afford a van less than k in value and those tend to be older junkier. i absolutely do not want to breakdown on a highway, in the middle of nowhere, so i planned to bring any van i am considering buying to a mechanic. as a solo female, i find vans somewhat preferable to airbnbs, as i am in control of my own environment and i have a significant amount more privacy. there’s the labor upfront cost to factor in: i would have to outfit it to some extent and maybe hire an electrician to do the work that i can’t. it sounds like a fun project, but i have about two months to wrap everything up and i’d like
my basics handled (bed, place to keep food, etc) before i hit the road. both options have pros and cons, like convenience and stability vs comfort and ease. i’d like to hear your opinions on whether airbnb or rv life is more financially feasible within my budget ( on lodging and transport, the other  needs to go to other expenses) and anything that might lighten the load. i’m considering teaming up with another solo female traveller to ease the cost of living a bit have companionship but if that’s not possible, i’d like to know the best way to do this alone. thanks so much!"

first time posting here. i'm a college student from the us and i would love to go to europe this upcoming summer for two reasons: see eu countries and visit my own home country (ukraine). i have a green card and i'm a ukrainian citizen so i assume entering both the us and ukraine wouldn't be a problem(or so it seems from iata website). i have a plan to start off in spain and then go to france, germany, poland and to ukraine. i was wondering how the entry process would work for every country and is there a way to do the entire trip in a train or smth like so. also, are there any tips for a trip like this on budget.

rakahr11,laelan,1,1612214671,"i came across some people here in this sub that talked about how much they loved the priority pass, how they could relax in lounges and how they have some sort of membership that allows them to upgrade or have access to reduced hotel prices, specials and tours. honestly when i am at the airport, i go see where my departure gate is, but will have a drink, some food or whatever and end up maybe  min before departure at the gate - normally i'd be one of the last people to board and feel i make good use of the waiting time. skipping everyone and sit in the plane for an hour longer actually doesn't make sense in my mind. why would you want to sit even longer than necessary in that plane? especially when you travel economy anyway? i also plan my flights so either my stop-over time is minimal or i plan a day-pass and have some local food. as i'll have accomodation, i can freshen up and sleep properly. i don't really see the advantages to wait in a lounge, other than it might be more private or some gimmicks you don't need. depending on the lounge i know there is a buffet and free drinks. looking on how much lounge access costs, it doesn't seem a great value. regarding upgrades i sometimes ask the staff after departure and might just be upgraded for a few dollars or even for free. i looked up the hotels that offer reduced prices and honestly, they aren't that great, even for the reduced price. maybe my way of travelling or my personality simply don't ""need"" all that but maybe i am missing something here. like, let's say you pay  bugs a year but will have all you can eat and drink buffets + plus a private and relaxed atmosphere.

Zealousideal-Top2651,lcgfcb,1,1612447827,"i booked my flight tickets through in january . the flight was one-way from barcelona to toronto for august . this flight was chosen mainly because it was a direct fight provided by westjet (a company i trust). for months before the trip, i was only given a westjet booking # and a hopper #. during the covid- months, lot of flights were cancelled and we were allowed to request a full refund in the form of a flight credit/voucher. i requested for that in the summer  but didn't hear anything from hopper for months and i emailed them again in november  about the status. i didn't get any response. there is no phone number that i can contact them with. i decided to give westjet a call to see if they can help. i found out that the ticket numbers did not belong to westjet (as theirs begin with ); instead they belong to a company called hahn air (theirs begin with ). i started doing some research on hopper and i found out it is very common for hopper to issue tickets for itineraries that cannot be ticketed on airline stock. i contacted iata to complain about hopper and they refused to provide me with any information or help. i went onto the hahn air website and tried to request a refund through their online form, but i didn't have hopper's iata code and they didn't recognize the ticket numbers, so that was useless. it was definitely a fraudulent misuse of the e-ticket system and the responsibility is known and shared by both hopper and hahn. i started a complaint file with better business bureau and hopper just simply refused to respond and the file was closed after several months. in the end, i never got my money back."

DirtyBoyzLifestyle,k5c1cw,1,1606925197,"## or my alternate clickbait title - living on the beach for  bucks a day for me this is probably the cheapest i have traveled. i just wanted to review how much we spent and what we spent it on to see what i can improve on, but at the same time to show everyone that traveling the world is not a costly thing. this is our total budget for [sam]() and i's stay in salinas, ecuador. **tl;dr:** groceries: $. going out/eating out/""activities"": $. flight: $ + transportation: $. airbnb: $ total cost for the trip: $,. as you can see it was not an expensive month,  days technically, with a total cost of just over $.k per person. ## groceries: $. we lived about a ten minute walk from the supermarket. it was called mi comisariato. it had six aisles with food, a section for fresh fruit / vegetables / meat / dairy products, and three smaller aisles for household products. while it was not a large selection they had everything we needed. i posted a couple photos so you can get a feel for what the store looked like. our typical shopping trip to the grocery store was as follows: * a packet of ground beef * six greek yogurts
* granola
* brocoli
* carrots
* bananas
* apples
* blueberries
* pineapple
* eggs
* water we went to the store around three times a week and our cost per trip was usually around $. of course our total cost also included things like toilet paper, paper towels, rice, beans, laundry detergent, trash bags, and of course beer for the weekends. as you can see it was pretty easy to maintain a pretty western diet, while we were not able to find everything, it was pretty easy to keep eating what we were used to from home. since we were there for about four and a half weeks, i would count our cost per week at about $ or $ per person which i think is fairly cheap. ## going out/eating out/""activities"": $. this is the category where we probably could have cut back the most, we had two nights out with bar tab of over $. our actual activities were all free as we mostly explored on foot. overall here the drinks were fairly cheap, $ mixed drinks, $- beers, and $- meals. if sam and i were not a little obnoxious at times it would have been pretty easy to enjoy ourselves here on the cheap. i posted a couple photos of the food, but i will go into more detail in my review of salinas. ## flight: $ + transportation: $. we flew from chicago to miami and from miami to guayaquil, ecuador. from there we took a two hour cab ride to salinas. the price here is for both of our tickets one way. the cost of the rental car we took from pawnee to chicago was $, and the gas to fill up which was $. which is all included in transportation. on the way there we used uber since it was available in guayaquil and cost $. on the way home we used a yellow cab which cost us $ since there is no uber in salinas. i am certain that that was the ""gringo"" price and you could haggle them down a little. additionally, there is an option to take the bus from santa elena, a couple miles from salinas, to guayaquil which only costs $. sam was concerned about getting to the airport on time so we decided since were splitting the cost the $ for the cab were worth it to not have to worry. especially once you consider that we would have had to pay for the cab to the bus station in santa elena and again for a cab or uber once we arrived in guayaquil since the bus does not drop off at the airport. once we factored all of that in, we were fine with paying a small premium to just directly take a cab. while i feel like there was some room here to save some money, it was mostly dependent on how we valued our time by taking the bus. ## airbnb: $ i did a full review on the airbnb already which you can find [here](). overall, i think the value was good. it was close to the beach, affordable, and close to a grocery store. it was a little lacking when it came to what it offered past that, since it never quiet felt like a home and some essentials were lacking. but for the price the barebones feel could also have been expected. ## total cost for the trip: $,. again the total cost of the trip being about $.k for thirty-six is pretty reasonable. in theory you could cover the cost of this trip by working for $ per hour and still have a little money to save even after paying taxes in the us. i am looking forward to doing the budget for our next stop which is bogota in colombia and being able to compare the two. on paper bogota is supposed to be about % cheaper than ecuador, so i will be curious to see if this will also play out in our total spending."

(place gets a bad rep as a party place but most of those reviews are old - government changed everything - did the tubing and there was nobody drunk or acting rowdy. luang prabang (lots of people like this town i didn't really care for it - too fake tourist town for me) i know laos gets skipped by a lot of people - but like most people who've been there ""i love laos"" and go if you can. hostels are $- in the entire country. some were $ with breakfast and a pool. vietnam -  months - ha noi - cat ba/ha long bay - sa pa - da lat - danang - saigon ho chi minh city. hostels were the nicest and cleanest in vn. $- in the entire country. cheapest one was $. with ac and access to  pools, pool table etc etc etc. i bought a motorbike and rode  months from china to saigon camping in my tent most nights so i won't list all the cities. i'll add a link to my trip report if interested. philippines - manila - coron - el nido - port barton - puerta princessa - cebu city - moalboal - malapasqcua. food is terrible (street food) - lots of fat and bone in most meat, or parts of the chicken and pig most tourists won't want to eat) very little vegetables, no flavor, no spice. i find it noticibly poorer here than the other countries and it's not even close. mostly very friendly people. budget hostels are generally pretty gross here, old, dirty, lots of things broken, and double the price of the other country. most hostels are $- a night. internet is always a struggle here too.. the whole island of palawan was without internet for over a month when i was there. if it does work it's slow and spotty. food: in every single town and city in all the above countries you can get a local street food meal for $-.. every single one. all you have to do is walk - minutes in any direction away from the tourist area. tourist or western style food (burgers pizza) will be -x the price. crossing borders: lots of scamming - fake insurance - face entry and exit fees etc. bus drivers making up fake new government laws etc - so do some research ahead of time. i did a long post here on reddit if you search in r/laos if you want to read about it - when crossing from cambodia to laos where i had a lengthy stand off with border agents trying to scam me out of $. i know.. i know.. ""just pay the $"" .. i just don't like being scammed or paying bribes.. and if more people make a stand.. these scams will go away. scooters and motorbikes: yes it can be dangerous and check your insurance before riding but there is absolutely no better way to go around many of the tourist places in these countries. i learned in thailand and disagree with most who say it's a bad country to learn in as there's huge shoulders everywhere and the roads are good compared to laos cambodia or the philippines. so i'd say if you're going to learn it's a great place to do it. but learning at home is probably best. just don't learn in a huge city like bangkok. also get an idp (international drivers permit) before leaving your home country as it'll save you fines and the stress of always looking over your shoulder or the rare huge fine $+ and motorbike impoundment. i paid - fines for $- in thailand and vietnam. and blew part many other checkpoints where they told me to stop but pretended not to notice. it's stressful.. get yourself the idp. aaa sells them in the usa. scooter rental is usually $ a day. i've paid as little as $ and i think $ was the most. for those wanting to stay in these countries longer - you can get studios in all the counties except singapore for around $- in most cities. i'm still in the philippines now and i pay $ per month for a large (for asia) studio in a nice clean well kept building and they even have $ per month ones here too. some parting tips. and are way cheaper and have way more options than cheaper % of the time, usually -% cheaper. i and most people i met all agreed once you figured it out. hostelworld is mostly a waste of time in se asia. flights are sometimes cheaper than taking the bus. i took a bus in thailand for like - hours for like $ and the flight was $. any questions? just ask?"

KiannaKayo,iysd9t,1,1600930875,"i understand that in the current times, some may not even need to purchase airline tickets, but for those who do or are planning future trips... **stay far far away from travelbe! do no use them under any circumstance!** i was one such unfortunate individual who was stuck overseas in april when the pandemic struck.
in my panic to get home asap, i googled cheap flights to return home and landed on travelbe's webpage. after i hasty and negligently booked a flight with them, thinking all will be fine, my flight was canceled due to newer and stricter restrictions being place upon the country i was trying to escape to. at first, i just thought it was unfortunate for me but boy was i wrong...
i called them up the moment i received a notification that my flight was canceled due to the said restrictions and they replied that i would have to contact the airlines about the issue.
-what?! why? i didn't book through them... i booked through you. why would i need to contact someone that i never talked to in the first place?-
fine.. i'll contact the airlines about this issue and to no one's surprise, the airline was confused as well, saying that i would need to contact the travel agency i booked my flight to get my refund. which makes sense, right?
i called up travelbe once more and again.. to no one's surprise, they said they have no control over this matter until the airline releases the order -bull. f*cking. sh*t.- it's now september, well over  months since this incident and travelbe still refuses to refund money for the ""service"" that i never received.
i'm still in the middle of a dispute with my card company, but the others at travelbe still think they are entitled to the money they blatantly scammed me of. tl;dr: **stay the hell away from travelbe,** do no use them unless you want to be scammed of your money. ordering through them is like throwing a bundle of cash into the ocean, and even then, that's probably more fun than coming into contact with such toxic scammers."

ThisOnlineWorldBlog,j43se1,1,1601675446,"hey everyone! i think one of the easiest ways to find cheap flights is to check other airports in your area rather than just sticking with the airport you typically fly out of. between doing this and taking red-eye flights, i think it's easy to shave a bit off of flying. outside of that, i've mostly been saving on travel costs by booking airbnbs for at least - weeks to get discounts whenever possible (obviously this isn't on the table for very short trips). however, that's about as far as i've taken my savings. anyone have something really out of the box to save money on flights or stays? :p this article on [finding cheap flights]() mentions some cashback websites and apps, but i've never used those for travel, just online shopping. [this article]() also mentions negotiating on airbnb prices with hosts. curious if this has worked for anyone! sorry for the noobish questions on my end. thanks for any advice!"

ArtichokeMother877,j6sp63,1,1602083800,"camper vans are becoming highly popular among campers now. it seems such a cozy shelter for camping purposes. it’s now used by people who are just beginners in camping as well as old people who would prefer a bit of comfort even when they’re trying to rough it out with nature. camper vans also reduce the amount of work we have to do in setting up our tents and makes everything easily available to us. it’s a great way to spend time outdoors without any of the risks of being out in the wilderness. if you own one, you’re already prepared for all future camping trips. and even if you don’t own a camper van, you can rent a good one within the price range of $ to $. whereas, many would say that tent camping is the essence of camping. if you mention camping, the first thing i’d think of is a row of tents all glowing in the night under the stars. okay, that’s a bit too much but i’m being honest. it does seem like the well-tried and tested shelter for camping out. tent camping is also the perfect way for you to bond with your family. you can learn about the benefits of some good time out in nature. it’s indeed the perfect way to self-reflect as you sit and hear the flow of a stream nearby or feel the breeze on your cheek.

oh_god_its_raining,ipimiz,1,1599666996,"hello fellow shoestring travelers, i'd like to share my experiences on how to live in a tourist town for next to nothing. a few items to note: ) during the pandemic, prices are a little lower than normal, so if you're not scared of the virus, right now is actually the best time to travel. mexico has zero restrictions for u.s. citizen tourists, although they do make you fill out a health questionnaire before you go through customs, you can only fly in (no land border crossings), and security is \*super tight\*. i had to show my health questionnaire to like five hundred people, had my bags searched multiple times, etc. also it took some doing to get the usual six month tourist visa. speaking spanish saved my ass in that regard, as the immigration official had to be talked into giving me the full six months. basically i told her that i was spending one month on puerto vallarta, one month in merida, one month in mexico city, etc. i really had to push for it. in the past they just gave you six months without a fuss, but yeah, it's a bit of a different world these days. ) i always use hostel volunteering/couchsurfing/work exchange/etc for my accommodation. hostels always have kitchens (with cooking oil and salt provided), and free filtered drinking water, so i never pay for accommodation or hydration. that said, i also live in a hostel dorm room with four other people, so no privacy, a/c, etc. wifi is usually hit or miss in these places, but it's not hard to find a cheap internet cafe. i'm using one right now, and it's  pesos/hour. ) i don't drink, smoke, or use drugs of any kind. i also don't eat meat or eat out in restaurants/bars. all this helps keep the prices down. ) i speak spanish. this does help with eliminating the ""gringo tax,"" but it never goes away completely. ) covid restrictions: mexico is like the us when it comes to covid - each state sets their own rules/restrictions. for example in mexico city, cancun, and playa del carmen the lockdown is pretty intense. you can't go to the beach/parks and all of the cool spots are closed. but in puerto vallarta (in the state of jalisco), everything is open. people do wear masks but they also don't freak out if you decide not to wear one. my feeling about masks has always been ""do what everyone else is doing,"" so i'll wear one in a store if i see the employees wearing them, and i don't wear one outside, as only half the people here wear masks outside. inside the hostel no one wears masks. i'm using an internet cafe right now and after i sat down to work i took my mask off. no one seems to care. so let's talk about puerto vallarta, centro neighborhood (far from the resorts) specifically. from now on i'll use pesos cuz i do everything in the local currency when i budget. food budget: oaxaca cheese (it's the best cheese!) = /half kilo. if you don't live on cheese that's enough for a week. produce: broccoli, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, peaches, plums, oranges = /week tortillas = /week misc guilty pleasure items (yogurt, butter, soda, etc) = /week other expenses: internet = /week at the wifi cafe toiletries: if you get the super cheap shampoo and sanitary products = /week typical meal plan: breakfast: tortillas or yogurt lunch: tortillas with cheese, fruit on the side dinner: steamed broccoli, fried potatoes with onions, chopped raw tomatoes with lime juice snacks: small pieces of cheese and fruit that's roughly /week,  if you splurge a bit on a bag of chips here and there. even at /week that's $./day usd. but then the question comes up, who wants to live like a pauper? well, no one. that's why choosing the right town is so important. you want a town that offers lots of free entertainment to help offset your frugal lifestyle. i tried living like this in playa del carmen, for example, with mixed results. the ""gringo tax"" was insane and everything fun required door charges, admission fees, etc. merida was slightly better but still frustratingly expensive for many things. mexico city and guanajuato were both insanely expensive. puerto vallarta has a ton of free entertainment. the beach, obviously, but also the public parks are lovely, full of nice benches, friendly people, and shady spots. the bars have live music seven days a week and most don't have any kind of door charge or drink minimum. if you're staying in a hostel you get to meet people from all over the world who are usually pretty broke as well, so group outings to go swimming in the ocean or just taking a walk around town are a daily occurrence. if you're looking for great deals on tourist attractions, sorry but i'm the wrong person to ask. i tend to stay at least - months in anyplace i visit, and i'm always doing work exchange and/or looking for side jobs the whole time so tourism really isn't my priority. hopefully these raw numbers, based on current prices, will help you budget for your (possible) future trip to the paradise that is puerto vallarta. happy travels!"
guernica-shah,ipjk88,1,1599669729,"[]() seems like the only provider offering this. at $ per week it's not badly priced (i'm . worldwide coverage excluding the us. it's $ if you're under ), although more than the uk-based providers i'm used to. $, maximum, which should be enough in most countries even if you end up in a coma for weeks (absolutely not enough for the usa though). the two negatives i see are: (i) unlike many travel policies, there's no short-term us coverage eg. you're visiting the states for a few days en route to somewhere else; (ii) there's only $, for medical evacuation, so in worst case scenarios there won't be a learjet to take your icu'd self home to die (unlikely, but happened to a friend years ago). any other providers out there offering covid- coverage?

* a bear canister * i know nothing, pls help
* a gps navigator * considering a gamin mini as it seems to be the most popular. hella expensive though so wondering if any other alternatives are available. how necessary is a gps system on a short trip like this?
* suggestions for a sufficient amount of food for  people and  nights at base camp, including the  mile hike in and out
* stove fuel suggestions
* kitchen supplies. suggestions please
* water bottle suggestions * i've seen lots of redditors claiming to simply use a smart water bottle as it's lightweight and durable.
* clothing suggestions for both of us * what do you usually wear/pack that is comfy, keeps you warm and maybe even helps keep you from smelling too bad. how many clothing items do you bring? * also, shoes!! my hike involves a decent amount of switchbacks through water, wondering what your favorite options are.
* toiletries/hygiene items suggestions
* trash suggestions
* human waste suggestions (e.g., trowel vs. bagging it up) thank you so very much if you've made it this far. i want this trip to be fun (it's for both of our birthdays) but also of course safe. i mentioned this a few times already but when it comes to gear i'm looking for a good blend of affordable, durable, and comfortable. though it will not be too long, this will be the first backpacking trip where i am the leader so i want to make sure that i do not leave anything out. i am extremely open to all suggestions, comments and criticisms. most of the gear i already possess was purchased on [r/geartrade]() or was given to me as a gift. finally, i'd love to hear how you all go about your backpacking/camping activities. your favorite tips and tricks from additional ""luxury"" items, to your most useful cost/time/effort cutting strategies, to your favorite on the trail songs. thank you!!"

mitchyslick8,hnwxi2,1,1594270068,"so we’re doing a long term rental with unlimited mileage through sixt. it’s a bigger car, like a yukon/sequoia size suv. the trip is planned around places we know people so we’ll be couchsurfing/sleeping in the back of the car most of the time except for a few cities where neither will be viable. looking at it estimates fuel costs to be ~$ for the trip from southern california, north up to or/wa, then east from there kind of zigzagging until we hit south carolina and then a more direct route through texas on the way back to ca. the rental seemed to be the cheapest option since neither of us have a car that we could reliably get from coast to coast. i tried the car/rv relocation sites but couldn’t find anything in our time frame or distance. essentially what we’re estimating is:
fuel:$
rental:$
daily food: $ per day for  days $
incidentals:$
so about $ per person does this seem realistic? anyone with experience doing a similar trip think i’m underestimating the costs?"

i’m warning you, avoid this company at all cost. just a word of warning this company works under three names farestore, skybooker and destina travel. avoid all three! i booked a flight with this company and due to the coronavirus the flight was cancelled. so i was given two options, a partial refund ($) of my $ ticket or $ of credit to be used towards a different flight. at first i decided to use the credit but then when i requested a date in november for the same route the company wanted an additional $ from me for this route. when comparing flights for the same time on different websites i was getting return flights for about $, in total, this company wanted $, from me. so i decided i would take the refund. i was told i would have my refund within  business days...  business days went by, no money. so i posted a review of this company online. i was then called by the company and threaten, “do you want to continue to write reviews online or do you want to get your money back”... what the fuck right?? so after going back and forward and realizing the $ they wanted originally was a bit much the company rebooked me on my flight in november for an additional $. once the flights are confirmed i call to pay my $ as first agreed on the phone, then by email and once more by phone before i pay. then my card is charged for $. i later email the company asking what this is about and apparently the extra $ is a ‘service fee’ to book the flight fare. i honestly would avoid this company at all costs. everytime you contact them by email a new customer service rep takes up your email and gives you a copy and paste answer from his word document. they will make your life a nightmate... i now have a flight booked under them in november and i wouldn’t be surprised if i turned up at the airport and my tickets don’t exist! you’ve been warned, avoid at all cost!"

. set up the initial infrastructure . form of government that i propose is a constitutional monarchy . country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament) . noble titles such as duke, earl, count, lord, baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island. . establishment of the government building . for now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved. . people will be made citizens at this location . establishment of civil services . waste collection, police, social services . establishment of a port . this will allow supplies to enter the island. . this will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(i will expand on this later). . the port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed. . establishment of resident housing . this temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up. . resident housing and the government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed . set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island . a partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
. make the island a desirable location . set up the island as a luxury city . free housing for citizens . free healthcare for citizens . free schooling and university for citizens . build resorts and legalize gambling on the island . the revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island . with the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city . the gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well . make the island a banking haven . set up a bank on the island . no kyc laws will be enforced on the island . this will attract forgien investment into the island . allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy . no income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island . commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes . this will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well . will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
. expand on the island infrastructure . build an airport. the islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets . build more free luxury housing for residents . establish schools and universities . establish libraries . establish museums . establish a healthcare system
. enjoy the luxury haven of an island that we have built now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding according to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $,, * the island itself * ,
* the port * , to build * this will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments * , for  passenger ferry * we will budget around , for operating costs
* initial buildings * ,, * these buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment. * buildings include
* civil services * around , to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies * another , to purchase atvs * another , to purchase off roading vehicles
* bitcoin mining operation * we will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* water purification * ,
* food supply * we will purchase mre’s and other preserved food products for the island * an exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* further development of the island * this will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes now in regards to how we will raise that sum * we will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy) * while no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include * duke, duchess. * marquess, marchioness. * earl, countess. * viscount, viscountess. * baron, baroness.
* a small percentage of the island (less than %) will be earmarked for sale immediately. the part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws. * on a  acre island,  acres would be marked for sale * the acres on this haven of an island will be sold for , each so the island would raise . million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax * digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation * we will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this * solar powered web hosting
* people can become citizens for a fee of $ which will mainly go to the printing of their id and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this if you have made it this far, please join the [subreddit]() for this plan more information to come soon, thank you."

TravelCenter_UK,ggc2q7,1,1589014633,"five methods to acquire the most out of your trips: think about a work-trade agreement. holiday deals might seem worth the cash and ease, but what if you can acquire all those enjoyable, native encounters and complimentary lodging? work-trade arrangements offer you just that. how it works is easy and precisely as it sounds: you work in places doing anything from milking goats to organic agriculture to easy house sitting and several more in exchange for a roof above your head. hire an apartment or do a home swap. customarily, holiday-goers have had to reserve a hotel to acquire the facilities of home in a foreign metropolis, but not anymore. even if you’re dedicated to having a luxury holiday, mainly for a honeymoon, anniversary or big birthday, you could locate luxury lodgings at not-so-high charges. apartment and house hires (within local guides of your destination at or ), home swaps (, ) and hiring single rooms inside bigger homes (airbnb) mean that you could receive kitchen stove rights, wi-fi access and perfect natural features without paying too much. purchase native food and cook. given that you’re visiting a place that has reachable grocery shops or farmer’s bazaars, buy native food and think about a charming picnic at one of the adjacent locations or parks. if you have kitchen access, try cooking with never-before-utilized products. in the awareness of saving cash, study in advance what’s native (and therefore, inexpensive) to your city. walk all over. in the distress of the holiday mindset, throwing unfamiliar amounts of (foreign) cash at cab drivers could frequently be a go-to routine for steering unaccustomed locations. presuming that you’re traveling in a secure region and are able-bodied, you could come across all types of concealed places and stunning locations while steering on your own two feet. redefine mementos. expensive tchotchkes in tourist stores and airports might summon but repel. what are mementos but a gesture to friends and family that you were thinking of them while you were away from home? you do not want a £ keychain from a hawaiian gift store to tell them this. it’s usually safe to stay away from purchasing any present at an airport, hotel lobby or any location that bears the term “gift store.”"

pacet_luzek,gm9l3v,1,1589834034,"i'm italian and often during my travels people ask me questions about pasta. here is my go-to fundamental oil-based structure, hoping it can help you get the most out of your groceries. chop onion and/or garlic in small pieces. put it in a large pan with generous oil (better if olive extra virgin). you can also add olives, dried tomatoes, pepper, chili pepper, laurel leaves and anchovies (or minced cured meat) at this point. as a general rule, black pepper goes with onion; chili pepper with garlic. low heat fry and stir until the onion/garlic gets golden. then add dry herbs, capers, chopped vegetables (including tomatoes, fresh or canned), mushrooms, meat or fish or already soft pulses. aubergines, carrots and bell peppers may need different treatment as they take much longer to cook, so they should be cooked a bit already before oil and garlic/onion, unless they are cut thinly. cook and stir until almost ready, then keep warm with the lowest heat setting. at the same time, get a pot of water boiling, add quite some salt (water must taste just a bit less salty than the average seawater, or like an almost unbearably salty soup) and then add the pasta, possibly of good quality. when the pasta is still hard, but getting close to ready (roughly after / of the cooking time written on the package), take it out of the water and unite it into the pan with the sauce. don't throw away the pasta's cooking water for any reason. bring back to mid-high heat and stir together mixing pasta and sauce, slowly adding the starchy pasta water with a ladle until the pasta is almost perfectly al dente (firm core but edible). add salt and pepper to taste, then let it rest for a minute, lid on. if you want to put cheese or cream (both forbidden if you used anchovies or fish, exceptions may include salmon or shrimps with cream) this is the time. in case of cheese, let it melt for a handful minutes. also, fresh herbs such as basil and parsley should be abundant and added last. shred parmesan or pecorino directly on the plates, along with more fresh herbs, freshly squeezed lemon juice and a final splish of olive oil. buon appetito."

TravellingDivorcee,gnesto,1,1589992904,"so what’s your travel hacks for saving money on food when on the road? eating out is one of the great pleasures of travelling isn’t it? but it also starts to rack up on the old purse strings. so you can save a fair bit of cash i’ve noticed if you’re a little clever and you make a effort. for me breakfast is the most overrated meal when it comes to eating i don’t, if i’m travelling in europe i just take my breakfast cereal measured out into separate bags for the few days i’m away,i buy milk when i land and i’m good to go...breakfast is covered. for lunch (again this is euro-centric ) i’ll go head to an indoor market where there’s always a few eateries with communal seating or if that’s not available then i’ll head to a lidl or other cheapo supermarket and make my own sandwich/salad and go sit in a park or plaza and watch the world go buy.
often in big cities restaurants will have a limited lunchtime special and i’ll treat myself to that but will only drink my own water. for drinking alcohol i will treat myself and head to a few bars to drink beer... no point in travelling just to sit and count the pennies right? so i usually head to a bar around  to hit any happy hours and then depending on the crowd and the mood i’ll either stay out and get a takeaway on the way home or more likely hit the supermarket again to buy simple vegetables and pasta and head back to the hostel with a cheap bottle of vine and i’ll cook up a storm .... there’s always left over condiments like olive oil, salt/ pepper etc and i always gift any leftovers to other travellers. another thing i always avoid is buying food at the airport so before leaving i’ll make a sandwich at home or at the hostel and eat that to keep me going
i always have an empty water bottle that i ask staff at the airport restaurants to fill for me. i realise the above is nothing new but thought i’d share how i save a few $ when travelling. anyone got others ways to save on food when on the road?"

archersonly,fdc8os,1,1583324682,"last week i made a post on why i think shoestring travel gives you a richer experience, but now it's time to write about *how* i travel on a shoestring budget. there are many ways i manage to travel on a shoestring budget and i've compiled a list of  of my favourite budget travel tips that i use. i'm interested in what you guys think, which you agree with or disagree with and which tips you would add? **. keep it local** the idea is to try and spend as little as the locals in underdeveloped countries and as little as the working class locals in developed countries. that means we need to eat where they eat and travel how they travel. i.e eating at local restaurants or street food and travelling by local bus, train or boat. of course we're not going to be able to spend as little as them as they're not sleeping in hostels or going to museums, but the more local we go, the better. **. travel light** something that's often overlooked in the world of shoestring travel. personally i think it's vital for many reasons. most obviously not paying hold fees on airlines, but it's a lot more than that. travelling light also allows you go wherever you want, such as chicken buses in central america or the subway in modern cities. people travelling with huge backpacks/ suitcases are often forced to get taxis instead. travelling light also allows you to take advantage of the best shoestring travel method; walking! **. don't fly** this one depends on where you are in the world, as in some places budget airlines are extremely cheap. that being said, in most areas of the world public transport is still the cheapest means of getting around, and in my opinion it's the best way to see the country. **. research** knowledge is power! the more you know about a destination, the easier it will be to stick to budget. knowing where to eat and how to get around can make all the difference. also having some idea of the prices will stop you being ripped off by those deceitful types preying on unsuspecting travellers. **. avoid guided tours and make your own excursions** having a tour guide can be pretty useful however it's not going to help you travel cheap. what i like to do is make my own excursions. just hire a scooter/bicycle and drive around the sites yourself. not only is this easy on your budget, it also gives you complete freedom. a little bit of research before your diy excursion and you're good to go. just make sure you don't get lost (unless that's your goal). **. don't drink too much** i know, this ones harder said then done. however the biggest expenditure for most backpackers is all that drink! i'm definitely guilty of this myself, but if you can limit the drink you're going to save big. **. cook your own food** i'm definitely not saying don't eat at local restaurants but embracing the hostel kitchen is a great way to travel cheap. shop at the market and cook up a feast (or just cook some basic pasta from the supermarket). the more you cook the more you save, especially if you're in a more expensive country. keep in mind though, sometimes street food can be even cheaper than cooking yourself. it's also probably more delicious, no offence! **. travel in the off season** cheaper flights and accommodation are the main reasons to travel in the off season. other benefits include less tourists, shorter lines and more availability. **. learn from locals (and other backpackers)** this takes us back to 'keep it local'. there's nobody that knows the place like the locals! asking them what to do and where to eat etc is a great way to learn how to travel cheap. you can also learn from other backpackers in hostels, which is a great way to get a conversation going. **. travel to cheaper countries** we're not saying that it's impossible to travel scandinavia or japan on a budget. but it's much easier to do so in the philippines. the easiest, and most obvious, way to travel cheap is to go to a cheap country. duh! despite that, i don't recommend skipping countries just because they're expensive, you've just got to be smarter. #xb; what tips do you guys have that i haven't included here? this is just  tips, on my new blog (theshoestringbackpackers) i've wrote a list of  tips so check that out if you want. feedback is appreciated."

michigamii,fe2a9j,1,1583443063,"i am currently a broke-ass teaching assistant living in paris. the past year and a half i have done many city-breaks and longer trips to mostly urban areas throughout europe and, while i still love exploring cities, i really am in need of some beautiful nature and hiking (paris stresses me the fuck out haha). i have a -week holiday from school in mid-april. i wouldn't mind exploring a cool city or town nearby to nature and to keep it shoestringy i'll probably need to set up camp in a place accessible by train, bus or blablacar (not planning on renting a car so unfortunately can't go anywhere super remote). i also want to see more of france as i have been traveling internationally pretty often lately (thank you cheap inter-europe flights!). i have been to paris, marseille, annecy, lyon, the loire region and ile-d'oleron/la rochelle in france. i am interested the pyrenees and the gorges du verdon with possibly swinging by provence? not really sure exactly where to go. any suggestions on how to do this trip/where to go? looking for sun, hiking, lakes, beautiful nature, charming cities, not too expensive etc. thank you!"

Runningoutofideas_81,fedrlv,1,1583502798,"i have spent the last  months getting my online english teaching job off the ground and i am starting to feel comfortable enough to be more mobile with it. i need to go live somewhere cheap where i can save money on the necessities of life, like food and utilities. i need to pay down some credit card debt. places i am personally interested in, in no order: mexico, southeast asia, india, latin/south america, eastern europe. my ideal criteria would be: reliable internet, beaches (learning to surf, scuba/snorkelling), hiking/camping opportunities, abundant wildlife, low cost of living (healthier food preferred). cheap to rent/buy motorcycles. somewhat safe for dental tourism. i do have a couple of places in canada i can stay at basically free, but food is generally expensive. it would be nice to ride my motorcycle to the destination, but i am open to renting/buying once there. i can reliably get cheap airfare to mexico, but would be relying on scott's cheap flights for anywhere else. i don't want to overload myself, so as much as i would love to visit some crazier places, i want a gentle transition into nomad life. so places with less of a language/cultural barrier would be preferred (i speak/read low level french, and very little spanish.) if you were me, where would you go?"
