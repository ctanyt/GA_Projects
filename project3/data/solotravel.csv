I just want calm, exploration, and peace. lol. 

I also am not comfortable driving. I would like to hop around 2-3 cities. so transportation needs to be relatively easy.

anchovi-suckeroni,p8nagi,How to meet people traveling solo?,"Hi,

I'm wondering how you best meet people traveling solo. I have so far always avoided people on my travels, in fact in life in general. I am now 31 and I deeply regret having lived life as a loner. Not only have I never had the opportunity to meet any women that way (whenever I was single) but even just people in general.

On my next travels I'd like to change that. I'd like to go among people as much as possible and just have fun.

Now having avoided people mostly in my life I wonder, where do you meet fellow travelers and make friends?

Usually when I stayed at a hostel I only saw groups of people and never really saw any opportunity to get myself noticed without seeming like a weirdo who wants to interrupt a group of tight friends. Not that I would have wanted to at the time anyway.

So how do you meet people as a solo traveler?

The only time I really ended up meeting people on solo travels was when on two different trips some two groups of girls randomly recognized me in a city after having seen me at the hostel before and suggested I join them. But that's just luck and not something I can rely on to happen again. 

I love traveling solo but I think I have missed out enjoying good times with other people so I'd like to take the initiative and actively seek out people to do things with. Go sight seeing with, or relax at night with.

I'm assuming that staying in hostels will be my best bet to make friends, but how exactly do you get yourself added to a group of people without being intrusive?

Or what about campgrounds or other places travelers frequent?",solotravel,1629531446
strangely_unlucky,p8oeh1,"Upcoming Germany/Austria trip for 1 month - October, need advice","Hey! I'm a 23 years old guy looking to spend around 1 month in another country in October, either Germany or Austria (I'm currently learning german and I want to go to a german speaking country to help me with that). I plan on driving there so that I can have my car with me to move around the country if I want to, but essentially I would like to spend that month mostly in one city, to see what life there looks like. If restrictions are not too harsh, I would also like to go out at night sometimes, to visit stuff, to meet new people and so on. I'm 100% set on doing this, it's been on my mind for a few years now. The thing is, I've travelled outside my country only 4 times and it's been for 3 to 5 days trips, so this is going to be a totally new experience for me. Any advice I can get? Any suggestions regarding the city I should be choosing? I'm a total newbie and any information would be helpful regarding this trip. Thanks!

P.S: I am a software developer and I work remotely, so this month I would still be working half of the day, so I would prefer renting an airbnb instead of going to hostels.  
P.S 2: The ideal trip for me would be staying for one month in one city, then travelling around the country for around 1 week visiting stuff. I mostly look forward to experience a different lifestyle for that 1 month, not really the tourist type.",solotravel,1629537524
ButterLord12342,p8x1ey,How much should I expect to spend in Athens for a 1 week trip while being frugal?,"Looking to go to Athens some point soon after my Uni breaks up at the end of the semester. I'm a student and I have a very low payjng job. So I'd prefer to spend as little as possible while still havibg a good time.

I'm wondering how much it would cost to spend a week in Athens while being as frugal as possible. I am planning on staying in a hostel, or at least a very cheap hotel. 

Mostly I'm going there to see the ruins and monuments since I'm studying Ancient History at uni, and I figure it would be nice to see some of the stuff I've learnt and wrote essays about in person. So i wxpect a good amount of my budget will be consumed by tickets and entry costs to various places.

Also how much is food? I know Greece is one of the cheapest European countries to holiday in, but how much does stuff like Street food cost, and then how much do restaraunts and tea shops cost?

How much would transportation cost? I plan on walking as much as possible, but I assume taking the bus or a cab will be necassary sometimes. And am I likely to be overcharged by cab drivers by them giving me ""tours"" or just lying abiut the price?",solotravel,1629571963

The-Smelliest-Cat,loh5w8,"What are some good countries/cities to rent an apartment, and stay in for a month or two?","Sometime next year I'm hoping to embark on a longer trip around the world, potentially for a year or so. But rather than be on the move all the time, I'd love to have a couple of places where I could just rent an apartment and stay in for a month or two. Somewhere to rest, and spend more time getting to know the place. Maybe go to a class or something along those lines! 

I've not looked into it much, but I know that not everywhere lets you stay so long, and renting an apartment isn't such an easy thing to do in a lot of places. So I was wondering if anyone has any good suggestions, or had done something like that somewhere themselves? 

Ideally it would be:

- Not *horribly* expensive. Prefferably under $1000 a month for a full private apartment. (cheaper is better!)
- A large city with plenty to see and do. 
- English friendly. (doesn't need to be English speaking, but somewhere where you can get by easily enough with English)
- If not a large city, then a very nice environment. Like a very mountainous region, or a nice beach. 
- Good public transport, and low crime.
- Lots of day trips to go on. 

As I said I've not looked into it too much, but my current thoughts are (I live in the UK):

- Hong Kong
- Singapore 
- Barcelona
- Somewhere in the USA (Miami/Vegas/NYC/San Francisco/Chicago/Honolulu)
- Bangkok
- Somewhere in Australia or NZ (Sydney/Melbourne/Auckland)",solotravel,1613856472

neoakshat,lox2ju,Local host/expert,"Hey guys,
I have been Solo travelling for many years now and ensure that I get one in every couple of years.

In my last visit to Portugal (before COVID-19) I had a different experience altogether.

I got in touch with and was basically hosted by a local living in Porto.

Even though I hate to be anchored during my solo travels and love the authenticity which comes with an unplanned trip. This guy totally blew me off with the local knowledge he had- about places to see, off the radar wineries, bespoke cafes and bars. Hated it then but came out with a much fulfilling feeling of having visited the place like a local. 

Do you guys try to get in touch with some locals before you visit a place? I’m actually thinking of creating a platform for solo travel enthusiasts to cross-host travelers. I feel this could provide a unique take on the place and could be a real value add for the traveler.

What do you guys think?

lapetiteaudrey,lptrcv,I have been toying with the idea of travelling through Southeast Asia for at least a month of two but I never tried travelling by myself,"So I have always been attracted to these countries and found them fascinating so I have been toying with the idea of travelling there for several weeks (at least 1 or 2 months but max 3-4 months maybe 6 if I am really into it).

I have 5k saved but I am making more soon but I am 21 yo female with no solo travel experience!

It sounds crazy and I know many women travel solo but I am seriously tempted. Is it worth to spend basically nearly or all my budget for this?

I have some plans of what I want to do afterwards but I need some adventure first, I am planning to visit Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand but for some reason I really want to see Indonesia!

Years ago I visited an exposition where they represented and I was mindblown by the Indonesian one. We wore a VR where they showed the nature etc and wow

I mean I obviously want to see all the islands but Bali too. I need to inform myself because geographically I am ignorant about the names of the exact area and I can’t speak the native languages.

I have anxiety issues but what attracts me the most is that I can backpack safely in a cheap way (at least based on what I heard) for longer than just a couple of weeks.

I considered traveling nearby (I am in Italy) but everything is expensive here in Italy or Europe (especially in big cities) and we have tons of restrictions due to Covid-19 so it is not possible to be away for weeks.

Am I insane? What can be a realistic budget ? 

2-3 months maybe? Considering ticket, health insurance, extra stuff, food transport, potential extra to keep in case shit happens, the Visa has a certain cost too.

2k-3k? 4k dollars?",solotravel,1614013710

Some circumstances in regards to my studies means I will have time off from end of may all the way till end of august.

So I was thinking I wanted to do some hiking from my parent's summerhouse for an extended period before the summer begins (by then it becomes crowded in the area).

Now my question is: how has it worked out for those of you who've taken time off of work for, let's say a month? I know it'll be different from job to job, but I just want to hear your input: was it easy? Did your employers ask for a reason as to why?

I looked in my calendar, and although the roster hasn't been made for the period, I can already see I have one meeting scheduled (which took 3 attempts to find a date).

I've done so much traveling with my bf and will continue to do that when I get back from my solo trip which is a month long, but I want to try something different and have my own adventure and he will have his own adventure while I'm gone. We are not a traditional couple and we highly value freedom and goddamnit we've been together for almost half of our lives - to say we are secure in our relationship is the understatement of the century.

Currently learning computer coding on the side, but it's very early days still.

I have about £30k saved up, but don't want to hamper my funds too much. Equally though, I don't want a big gap on my CV. But I do want to enjoy travelling too :-D. And I just wonder if I will do that whilst sitting inside my Airbnb, working a 9-5 gig.

The other issue too is we don't know how long we might have to wait to travel. Here in the UK, the noise is that we could be in lockdown for a very long time still.

theSoloLazyTraveller,l46rda,How to make your solo travelling experience better?,"Hi all solo travellers!! 

This is a follow-up question on my school project. I posted onto this group a month ago asking about the biggest challenges/why people  travel alone.

**To recap, here were the top challenges:**

1. Safety
2. Feeling Alone at times. 
3. Nobody able to take their photos (Too many selfies)
4. Watching their belongings   


**Why  solo travel:**

1. Freedom (Do and go whatever and where I want)
2. Can't match schedule with friends (Don't wait to wait)

  
**Problem**: As a solo traveller, I need to be concerned about my safety and belongings, this restricts me from doing all the activities I want to do.

**Hypothesis:** I believe that by providing a service that will ensure safety and aid to all solo travellers, it will help them achieve a memorable trip 

**Possible Solution:**  
I was thinking that in order to solve these challenges, there can be a service/platform to help solo travellers.  The idea behind this service is to pair a local ""tour"" guide to a solo traveller. That way the local guide can bring you around, feel safe, help take photos, etc.

I would love to hear everyone's feedback on the idea, and whether or not this will ""help"" them on their travels. Please see the poll, on possible features on the platform.

Thanks in advance!!

While on this trip I was the happiest and most free I’ve felt in my entire life. Now that I’ve been back for 5 months I’m not sure which path to take. Should I save up some more money for a couple months again and travel but be unsure about my future. I want to travel full time and have the thrill and adventure I had on that trip that I once took, but unfortunately this isn’t sustainable I want to be able to connect with people through social media and help them. Sadly the likelihood of me actually becoming successful and be able to fund my travels is very slim. I’m also contemplating going to college and becoming a travel surgical tech and using that to fund my adventures. Although I find health care somewhat fascinating I just couldn’t see myself being in that field. I would only use that job for the funds and stability of income to be able to travel. I know life is very precious and yes I’m young but my life could be over any second so I want to do what I love. Also I want something that I know I can make money doing so I can travel as long as I want. I just don’t want to waste 5 years of my life stuck in the same place before I can even start my dream. I’m really torn up about this and have been contemplating both options for a couple months now. Any insight would be appreciated. Thank You :)",solotravel,1611555834
5harmoota,l4iexq,Solo roadtrips: would you choose vanlife or a car and camping/stay in AirBnB combo?,"My car is dying and I need to buy a vehicle to last me until it's safe to travel internationally again. Vanlife has been on my mind for the past few months for being a relatively ""safe"" method of travel during COVID, and I've test driven a few vans but I am too scared to pull the trigger. My main hesitations are:

1. I've never slept in a vehicle before and it kind of scares me.
2. I don't love driving a large vehicle.
3. I'm afraid I'll have a hard time selling it afterwards because I don't plan on doing it long term, only (hopefully) a few months until it's safe to travel internationally again.

That being said, I feel like roadtripping in a car may be more expensive and less covid safe? If I'm in a city I can't exactly cook meals or poop in a bucket in my car lol so I'd have to go in and out of places. I also work remotely so sitting inside a car to work on the road would be very uncomfortable.

For anyone who's had staph infection, it was the worst pain of my life. I'll spare you the details but it was on the buttocks and I should have gone to the hospital, I was NOT OK. But I've seen a friend who got staph infection get cut open, drained, stuffed with gauze. He was recovering with a gaping hole in his calf from the surgery, stuffing it with cotton balls and waiting it out. I did not have time for a gaping butt wound, which would have surely taken more than two weeks to heal. And the American health care is expensive and I had already spent a lot of my extra funds on the trip.

 That being said I was coming down with a bad fever from the infection, leaking tons of fluids from the wound and taking so much ibuprofen for the pain and fever that my liver is probably permanently damaged. I decided to keep at it, cover the wound with medical honey 24/7 to keep it clean/open to be able to drain on my own and ultimately it healed enough to be closed about one day before my flight. 

There would have been to way I could (1) lived with myself if I had risked infecting other people through all the water, pools and hot springs I planned to visit from my wound not healing, and (2) been able to swim risking infection and loss of buttock? or whatever happens if you infect a staph infection with other infections.

The rough plan: fly from Boston to salt lake (have an n95 for the flight). Week 1: ski + stay at Airbnb (resorts of social distance guidelines). Week 2-3: drive around the national parks + camp at BLM. Flu back to Boston, and quarantine for 10 days with 2 neg tests

CV2nm,kimu3g,Crazy hostel experiences,"So, I'm not solo travelling (I'm backpacking with my boyfriend) but I thought this would be the best place to share my crazy experience. 

Moved into a hostel about 2 days ago, due to start working for accommodation on Saturday for hostel, so currently still paying. The room i've moved into is next to a noisy room, where people want to stay up late, have their friends in the room til late playing music, banging door to get in. It's annoying.

So after the second night of this happening, wakes me up at 1:30am (i've got work all day for a client so not good) - I knock the door ask them to turn music down, ignored. Knock again, finally stops. 

The next morning, I realise the noisy person is also the night manager and the cleaner, who angrily barks at people who don't clean up after themselves. So instead of going straight to reception to complain, I decide to speak with my new colleague now she is sober, and it's morning to ask her to go downstairs next time she hosts a party because we're neighbours. She goes crazy. Mental. Before I know it, she's cornering me in the bathroom threatening to punch me in the face. I can't move, she's actually physically blocked me with the steam cleaner. I keep my cool, stand my ground, until a girl brushing her teeth breaks it up. But she's not finished with me, she returns seconds later, telling me how she's going to shove my head in the toilet. At this point - I go to the manager, who is already coming out to see what the racket is all about. But the girls following me down the corridor, telling me about how she can't wait to put my head in shit. 

An hour later, she is removed from the hostel and ever since she has been wandering the street, walking around the block for a good solid 6 hours.   


I guess my reason for posting and interest is, anyone else experienced this level of crazy in hostels? Or worse? let's share stories!",solotravel,1608700546

The countries I am predominantly looking at are Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam but any advice on the Philippines and Malaysia is also appreciated. 

Time is much less of an issue than cost. So is it a cost effective way of travelling? 

Will it require booking months in advance or could I show up on the day and get a ticket? 

In terms of cargo ships, am I completely left to my own devices with food etc or is there some sort of canteen on board?

nrodge76,kj0k37,Formative Friendship Experiences,"We all have had them, experiences with strangers, family, or new friends on the road that bond you together. Situations, good or bad, where you need to rely on each other &amp; get through. After them you feel forever connected for whatever reason. I want to hear yours!

Let me set the scene. A couple of years ago my cousin Risa visited me in Central America during a trip. We met a Swedish friend, Anna, and after a week of hanging in Utila and getting PADI certified we hired a ‘private’ shuttle to bring us from the Caribbean coast of Honduras to El Tunco, El Salvador on the pacific side. The whole trip was suppose to take about 5 hours and we paid about $80USD total. We wanted to be safe because we were gringos &amp; heard some nightmares from other travelers about some of the rougher parts of Honduras and ES. 

We woke up at 3am and sat outside our hostel when a brown minivan pulled up. (We were told it would be a shuttle but hey, Central America) Out came Peter who said he was our shuttle... We reluctantly got into the van. He assured us that everything was going to be fine as he hit the gas peddle. Literally did not give a bother about the speed bumps, he was sending it. (In the front was his baby mama, smacking some gum, checking her nails and ignoring every attempt to communicate with us.) I decided that this car ride would be the perfect time to take an edible I got on Utila. I could just snooze, wake up at the border, and then finish out the ride to El Salvador. So I dozed off very quickly.

At 6am I was abruptly woken up by Peter who was asking for our passports. As I came out of my high, sleepy daze I realized we had been brought to a mall parking lot. The lot was mainly empty except for two torched/battered vehicles and Peter was getting aggressive at this point so I asked him where we were and why he needed our passports. He said we were in Tegucigalpa &amp; he was putting us on a bus and that we shouldn’t worry. We were pissed. But he was not going to take us any further and the bus kiosk was in the mall. I was not about to give this man of false promises our passports, so I walked in the mall with him. I had picked up enough Spanish to realize he had just made a profit since our new private shuttle was only 10$ a piece. Whatever. We waited at the terminal &amp; got on our bus.

The next part should have been smooth but it only got worse. (I realized I had left my snickers bar, earphones, and water bottle in Peter’s minivan.) At the border of ES Risa &amp; I got our passport stamps but Anna hadn’t gotten on the bus. The attendant came by &amp; said the bus needed to leave and we needed to get her. So I entered immigration only to see her outline behind a tinted door and two guards inside. Apparently, Anna was not allowed to enter into ES because she had two entrance stamps from Guatemala. (WTF?) They both had entrance circled. And one needed to have an exit circles. (But again we were entering the country FROM HONDURAS.) They said that she was not allowed until she got this fixed. As we left immigration Risa was on the road with our bags &amp; the bus left. By this point in time I am not as high, but it is noon and the sun is beating down on us as were in this weird limbo of not being in either country...

Enter Juan &amp; his taxi. He asks us where we need to go. Anna snarkily responds Guatemala &amp; he informs us that there is a border just 25 minutes away. We negotiate a price, re enter Honduras, and start the journey to Aguas Caliantes. On the way, Final destination style, a dump truck in front of us starts to lift all the boulders in its container at us. Juan was not the most attentive driver &amp; by the time we were reversing rocks were hitting the road. We get the border of Guatemala and the woman behind the counter laughs at our situation, and with a ballpoint pen crosses out the entrance section, circles the exit, and signs her name. She said that it’s fixed and now Anna should be able to enter. 

Well, Anna was not able to enter. After reexiting Honduras and attempting to enter ES, the same immigration officers said that they did not believe we had gone to the border of Guatemala &amp; that we forged this change in her passport. It was a very frustrating time. They said that Risa &amp; I could enter, but Anna could not. Then, it dawned on us, JUAN! Risa ran out and got him and he vouched for Anna. The immigration officers were clearing upset, and upon granting Anna permission into the country they looked at her as she was leaving and said, “Just know we have rules here in this country.” 

Getting from the border to the coast took another 3 taxis, a sketchy gas station in San Salvador, our cards getting declined, and all in all 22 hours before we were in beds at a hostel. It was the worst logistical nightmare to be in with limited Spanish. However, we lived to tell the tale. It’s interesting how these moments with these people can be looked back on with laughter &amp; fondness.",solotravel,1608755086

inoubliable33,kj55ub,Characters of London,"So a few days ago someone posted here asking for people’s experiences with the oddest people they’ve ever met in hostels... my reply got a lot of interest so I thought I might share for all, including those who were asking for daily updates:

I am currently living in a large hostel in London and due to covid there are a lot of long stay guests... this makes life quite interesting as most of these people are borderline homeless. 

The people include:
•  ""Spider-Man"" (61M) - A few weeks ago this guy got arrested for climbing the Big Ben dressed as spider man (search it up on google I dare you). He told me it was his 61st birthday stunt and he was protesting just about everything that’s gone wrong this year, Covid-19, Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ movements etc in a good old ""Fuck the government way"". He walks around the hostel everyday in his Spider-Man suit, but unfortunately is leaving tomorrow, along with his eight suitcases in two supermarket trolleys, on his way to Birmingham to apparently sue every member of parliament. Leaves me with a message of ""dont you worry, Spider-Man has much greater things planned soon"".

• ""The Pink Guy"" (20sM) - Scottish guy who always dressed in pink, ended up getting kicked out for the following reasons... screaming at a Coca-Cola can while laying on the floor, running away from police naked, wanking in his room and pooping in the street. 

• ""the Tall Dutch girl"" (29F), apparently came to London to be with the love of her life however he is never to be seen. She looses every bodies trust on day one after she goes through all of our bags in the dorm when we have all been sleeping together for weeks. Now she lives in the bathroom, assumably she sneaks into the hostel each day and sleeps there because she can’t afford to pay each night.

• ""The Man on the Phone"" (40sM) - who always seems to be talking on the phone however claims he’s talking to the ghosts of the building, I kid you not , full on arguments and everything. He left yesterday I believe as his neighbour was threatening to call the police as she was concerned for his mental well-being. 

• Now let’s introduce his neighbour ""the Crazy Lady"" (50sF), volunteers daily with NHS and comes off as a lovely person until, after staff explaining the kitchen is for restaurant use only she throws her sausage rolls at the bin which then falls over, shit everywhere. Sprinkles salt along the floor outside of her door in the hallway to keep the ""bad demons away"", goes round the hostel asking people if the had had any inexplainable experiences with ghosts in the building.

• ""The Eastern European girl"" (25F), the first time you see her, she’ll always be asking for a cigarette. But this girl got known for when she was hooking up with the ""Pink Guy"" in the smoking area, I think gossip flew round a lot because she was also a cleaner at the hostel. She must have quit her job at some point in the last week because now she sits across the road from the hostel on thé street with all her luggage and still, asks for cigarettes.

The idea I'm kicking around is

* Book 3-5 week trip
* Go to place and work from there one-two weeks, enjoy food and nightlife in the mean time
* Go on adventures in that place for the rest of the time.

And the countries I'm kicking around are

* Argentina (BA, Patagonia)
* Chile
* Costa Rica
* Mexico (CDMX, Yucatan)
* Colombia
* Peru

Things I like:

* Trying food I could never find anywhere else
* Mind-bogglingly beautiful vistas and hiking
* Getting a feel for a city
* Coffee
* Beaches, Volcanoes
* Friendly locals

1. Fly from US to Turkey via Paris on Air France. Free 23 kg check in baggage
2. Travel around Turkey using Turkish Airlines, trains, busses, or Skyexpress airlines. All airlines allow free check in baggage 
3. (If all countries lift Covid rules by then): Public transport or Train from Turkey to Georgia. Then Georgia onto Yerevan, Armenia. I will skip this section if countries still have covid rules.
4. Fly from either Turkey or Armenia to Kyiv, Ukraine. Airline will be either Ukraine International or Skyup. 23kg checked baggage will cost $15-$25
5. If the EU allows US travelers by then. Fly from Kyiv to Warsaw Poland on Skyup. Checking in will cost $13 (which is 50% of the cost of the flight). Then fly from Warsaw to Chicago on Tap Portugal. This will cost me an extra $50 vs purchasing the Tap Discount fare.

I don't know if this is a stupid or silly question, but I've always wondered.. is there ever an issue with trying to get from one city to another (or one country to the next), when there isn't any metro line.. bus route.. or train to get you there? In my country these services are only available in major cities, and everywhere else you either have to have a personal vehicle or call a cab/uber. In a foreign country I wouldn't feel comfortable calling a cab or anything similar with how prevalent modern slavery is and also I'm very paranoid about that kind of stuff. I've never called a cab or uber in my own country because I don't trust people.

Anyways, are there any other alternatives when these options aren't available? Or how can you assure that you will be safe when taking a taxi or cab? Thank you to anyone who is willing to educate me.

Money isn’t a big issue for me right now and I’m looking to make this trip as comfortable as possible so if y’all have any advice on accommodations that’d be awesome. I’m considering getting a nice air bnb or a condo but one with a pool is a must! I’ll most likely rent a car as well so any advice on companies to go through would be great. 

Also trying to figure out what I should look out for as far as Covid restrictions go. I’ve heard you have to get a test within 72 hours of flying but sometimes the results can take longer to get back which means I’d have to quarantine in my condo/air bnb which would suck! Anyone have to wait longer than 2 days for their results?

I’m also wondering if a lot of places and beaches are shut down. Shopping isn’t a big deal so stores being closed doesn’t really matter since I’ll be outdoors most of the time but I’m worried about beaches and hikes.

glory1812,jzkzsm,USEFUL TIP WHILE PLANNING A SAFARI TO TANZANIA,"Just thought I could share with youse this information.

One the things you need to know while planning your safari to Tanzania, Africa is ""Time to travel""

Here is the months breakdown which I thought could be helpful for someone to decide when to travel.

Tanzania Seasons: 

January to February: It is normally dry and hot. It is the calving season for the wilderbeests so the  wilderbeests will be at Southern part of Serengeti,  Ndutu area. Though February is the only time of the year which is guranteed to see the big herds all together move to South of Serengeti for calving. 
Easier to spot wildlife. 
Good time for birds watching since migratory birds are present.

March, April &amp; May, this is peak of wet season. Grasses becomes green and beautiful. Rains may interfere your trip,  parks are less crowded, low rates applies. Animals including the wilderbeests which are famous for migration are more dispersed.

June: It is a transitional period from rain season to dry season. Grassess become green. The wilderbeests start moving from Central to North Serengeti. Migration can be seen in the Western corridor of Serengeti until July.

July to October: It is dry season in Tanzania, Mostly sunny. Morning and nights get cold. From August to Sept the great heards of wilderbeests and Zebras move from Northern Serengeti to Maasai Mara by crossing Mara River,  Easy to spot animals because grasses will be grazed by hebivores and also most of animals concentrates around waterholes. It is quite crowded around Seronera area in Serengeti. High season rates applies.

November to December: It is short rain season though it is still not bad to come. The grasses becomes green and beautiful.

All in all, there is no bad time to visit Tanzania, Africa beacause each month has it's own uniqueness.",solotravel,1606149470

Ketamine_Crazywhoop,k0dpz0,Being Realistic,"Alright, hear me out, this might be a strange one. 

Ever since I've been 16 and watched Karl Watson's HK2NY, a bit of a desire to start travelling has morphed into a true, full-blown obsession. I've done a mass interrailing trip when I finished school, went around Italy for 3 weeks last year and had planned for Greece this summer but obviously, that didn't go ahead. Anyways this obsession has been completely tempted by fate due to me being a planner so last Christmas I had started planning a trip for 2022 - commencing 20th July to hit the Banana Pancake Trail, Oceania and finishing off in the US with Hawaii, San Fran and LA. 

When I tell you I've planned it - I have planned it to an inch of its life (yes, I understand the appeal to not booking things for after a month of the travel you have planned but I mean to go to quite a few events before I hit Bondi Beach on Christmas Day so I have to keep to a schedule in order to do the things I want to do) so I know where I'm going, the dates I'll be there, how I'm getting there, how much it would be to get there, the hostel I'm staying at, how much the hostel would be per night and per stay with a few activities thrown in and what visa sort documents I need to enter every country. 

When girls say all they wanna do is marry and have babies, this trip for around 10-11 months is all I want to do - and it's all I need to do as well. However, in this context of COVID-19, I'm trying to remain optimistic but how hopeful would a trip like this be? 

Leaving July 2022 and hitting Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and the US. 

Would this trip be viable to happen then (we're talking about with all the events going full blast as well, Full Moon Party, Christmas and NYE on Bondi etc.) or will I have to postpone it by a year?

I have read that certain trains (or compartments) are accessible only for Egyptian nationals and that as a foreigner, you have to book a more expensive luxury compartment (for example for going from Cairo to Luxor).

The same for ferries. I looked into the one from Hurghada to Sharm, and the price is way more expensive for tourists. 

Is there any way to avoid these restrictions and get normal train (and maybe ferry) tickets in Egypt? Is just buying the ticket once you are already on the train a viable option?

I wan to see the following places: 

- Cairo
- Luxor
- Aswan
- Dahab
- Mt. Sinai
- Maybe Alexandria 
- Maybe Abu Simpel

I am flying either into Hurghada or Sharm. If it is the latter, I guess it would be a good idea to start my trip in Dahab and spend one or two weeks there. But actually, I wanted to save Dahab for last, because otherwise I fear I might get ""stuck"" there and spend my whole month there lol.

So my question is this: How can I get from Hurghada to Cairo the cheapest way possible? I have looked into it, but couldn't find any options.

I don't want to take any flights.

Also, can you recommend any other places worth seeing in Egypt? I want to avoid resort towns like Sharm. I am interested in Ancient Egyptian History, Islamic history, laid-back places like Dahab...

I am 21, male, from the EU, I have been to countries such as India and Pakistan before, so I know my way around touts, pushy vendors, shitty buses etc.

This didn't quite came up spontaneously since we have been discussing this idea for a few months now with several of our mutual friends. Of one of those mutual friends (I'll call him Frank) has shared the idea of this trip extensively with Adam. Frank and I have known each other also for quite a while now and we have travelled together before so there should not be major suprises in behavior on our intended trip.

On top of that has Frank been to the locations Adam and I want to go a few times and is eager to go there again.

The thing is.. I have known Adam my entire life and we know each other trough and trough. I have travelled many times with him and I trust him with my life. When we are together we have the best time. We are able to discuss all the good and bad we face and have great fun doing it. The trip would mean the start of our adult life and fundament for our friendship in the years to come. 

I don't have that with Frank. Of him I know for sure that he is a difficult travel companion and just hard for me to communicate transparantly with. It is not that our relationship is completely bad or based on bad things. Not at all, we can have fun conversations and sort of like the same stuff but we just don't match that well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also know Frank well enough to know that he would be seriously - rightly so - suprised and angry if I tell him I only want to go to South America if he doesn't go with me and simultaneously I do not know how Adam would respond to me doing that. Adam and I have done a lot of stuff with just the two of us but I am not sure if he wants to go on with the trip if I cut out our partner like that.

29M from Canada here looking for a bit of advice or perspective. At the beginning of 2020 I got my 2 year tier 5 yms visa for the UK (valid until January 2022) with the plan to spend the next year or 2 traveling around the uk, working odd jobs and whatnot to support myself. Pretty standard I think. I flew over at the beginning of February and spent about a month there before COVID shut everything down and I decided to play it safe and come back home. Covid completely shut down my industry (live entertainment) so I've been here for the past few months working customer service jobs and whatnot to try and get some savings back but I feel like I'm kind of just wasting time at the moment, waiting for things to open back up (who isn't though). I've been kind of thinking if I'm just going through motions here, why not try and do it somewhere else? I'm also having a hard time letting the visa go to waste so I've been thinking of heading back in January/February and trying to make a go of it again for a few months at least or until things start to hopefully open up back home. 

So despite Covid I'm curious if anyone here has any suggestions about things to do or places to see in a Covid uk, considering I imagine most things will remain closed for the majority of this year or until a vaccine becomes more widespread. Big fan of the outdoors and just looking to explore and take in as much culture as I can given the situation. I'll likely start around London but from there who knows, I'm open to going wherever.

I understand this may come off as a bit tone-deaf/privileged given everything going on in the world at the moment but I'm just trying to make the best sense out of my situation and options.

Any feedback's appreciated, even just telling me it's still a horrible idea after all lol, as I'm still just brainstorming ideas right now before actually committing and booking anything. 

Thanks for reading and hopefully everyone's staying safe!

Throwawayrightaway28,k166cm,Experiences of Black women traveling solo in Italy,"My first solo trip was a couple years back. I spent three weeks in Europe and travelled mostly in France and Italy. I loved Paris. Now, I'm a black woman and my friends had told me Italy was amazing, specifically the larger cities. I actually expected more racism in Paris by reputation, but I never had one bad experience there. I travelled by train from Paris to Milan and that was the start of the longest ten days of my life. It was a NIGHTMARE. Seeing as this was my first solo trip and I knew nothing, I had two huge suitcases. I get off the Metro at Duomo, knowing I could get a taxi to my nearby Air BNB. Massive mistake. It was July, the sun was beating down full force and empty taxi after empty taxi passed me by as I was flagging them down. At first, I chalked it up to the size of my bags, my youth, anything and everything. After close to an hour,  I even left my bags in an alcove so I could just jump in front of the next empty taxi I saw and make them take me. (I was standing in front of a traffic light, so they had to stop). I was ignored and batted away.  Finally, a kind trans person came out of a local business and called me a private taxi. That's the service I used the rest of my time in Milan, I never could get a cab just by hailing there. And I didn't have phone service so I couldn't use Uber or Lyft. I've never been so aware of my color in all my life. I'm a 450 in Fenty, cocoa girl and I had long faux locs for traveling convenience. I was staying in a residential area of Milan and people would literally stare at me when I walked down the street. 

A lot of it was racism but some of it was xenophobia against the African immigrants there. When I wore any kind of American paraphernalia I was treated WAYYYYYYY better. I moved onto Rome quickly. It was better but still awful. I'll just never know what percentage was racial. One night, I went to a ballet at La Scala and bumped into some white American tourists. And they told me about how badly they were treated as tourists! Some of what they said sounded very familiar. That leg of trip wasn't all bad.

the_latest_greatest,k1915j,On the difficulty of crossing busy roads without cross-walks,"I have been pondering, as I have been watching travel videos and planning lovely future-tense vacations, where the hardest places to simply cross the road are?  


Nothing brings me more stress than a difficult-to-cross road. It was a deal-breaker for me in much of Vietnam, as I stood, my entire body hairs upright, bracing to cross several times a day for three weeks, and I would find my nervous system so aggravated by just trying to cross the road that I would spend my nights inside in defeat. I was in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Hue, Hoi An, and Can Tho, and other than Hoi An, every city was terrifying to cross at many intersections. Fastforward to Phnom Penh, and I loved it, in retrospect I think because I walked the corniche so often, although I once found myself again unable to cross a sea of motorcycles again at rush hour and wound up finally biding time in a store for an hour because I could not figure out how to cross the street -- even with locals -- without having a sort of sense of nervous collapse.   


I have been to Istanbul, a city of 20 million or so, and walked across a freeway once when lost, and did not feel at all anxious. So it's not only the number of people out, but also, how they drive.   


Since we can reflect now, and it has come to mind as I watch videos of Cairo, where it looks like Ho Chi Minh City all over again but cars, I find myself thinking, ""I don't want to ever go there"" or ""I'd go straight to Luxor, which could not be that bad! Nothing could be THAT bad, right?""   


I'm curious about three things now:   


1.) does anyone else just sometimes avoid traveling to places where they feel anxious about being run-over while crossing the street, not because they have unreasonable anxiety issues but because it's just hard? Do you find it kind of wrecks your whole day and you wind up trying to take cabs (that's what I did in Vietnam, and I am not a big fan of cabs for short distances -- I love walking the city streets!)  
2.) Where does the good people of this subreddit think the world's hardest cities to just cross the streets are, based on personal experience, and why?  
3.) (Optional) -- for anyone who has been to either Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi AND Cairo, or any other Egyptian cities, how did they compare? That's a kind of passing curiosity now.   


Thanks for your replies! Seeking future-chill travel which doesn't make my hair stand on end and leave me curled up in a ball in my guesthouse for the rest of the day after a one-hour excursion.

I am trying to avoid flights but will take one if absolutely necessary (I am not near Istanbul the end of the trip). This probably looks like a LOT for a month, but I have traveled at this pace before and I sleep like a baby in overnight transportation, so I don't usually get tired from fast-paced trips

If you have an Indian friend then spend a couple days in ONE city with them and eat lots of food. If you like clubbing then hit up some clubs, because the Indian clubbing experience is unique and lots of fun. But make sure to go with a native friend who has experience. I am from Delhi. 

2. Visit the mountains in the north. Go trekking. If any of you want recommendations on hiking companies then feel free to DM me.

3. Visit the south, I highly recommend the backwaters in Kerala.

4. Visit Rajasthan, a state with incredibly unique culture with everything from architecture, food, music and clothing. But do NOT visit the big cities like Jaipur. They aren’t worth it. 

5. Hit up some national parks. I recommend Kaziranga, Gir national park etc. 

6. The northeast is beautiful and you will never find culture like you find in certain places there, like Shillong and Nagaland. 

7. Continue on to Nepal or Bhutan.",solotravel,1603531525

Fruitcake36,jhpzxy,Did anyone struggle with asthma abroad? (central/south america etc),"I traveled to Mexico City a couple of years ago, and upon stepping out of the airport I felt as though it was a struggle to breathe. I only have mild asthma and it's never caused me a big problem to be honest. But as soon as I stepped into Mexico City I started to panic because this sensation of not being able to breathe just wouldn't leave. Either way, in the 2 weeks I was there, I got used to it eventually but I was never fully comfortable. I can only assume this is because MXC is high above sea level?

Been planning to go through CA/SA at some point next year by myself but I notice that many other SA/CA cities are high above sea level. Across Chile, Guatemala, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Bolivia, are cities with higher sea levels than MXC. 

Even without COVID right now, it makes me wonder how I will cope in these places? Has anyone else with asthma, or like in my case, mild asthma, traveled to these regions? Was it a struggle breathing etc?",solotravel,1603614171

My main target for this trip is to see several places linked with technology and transport which are not so close to each other. For early plans I decided to visit places in West Midlands, Shropshire, Cheshire etc. My biggest issue is how to travel across these counties or through them by the means of public transport. The routes for example like Liverpool-Chester-Birmingham or some small routes like Birmingham-Bridgnorth. Travelling by rail seem to be quite a good pn shorter routes (Return on the same day ticket what a great idea!) But they start be quite expensive on longer routes at least for my home country standards. If You have any tips for travelling by rail I would really appreciate them. As for other ways like Buses I have no idea at all but heard they are cheaper and of course can get You where there's no railway. There are of course car rent companies which I consider as well (of course that's not public transport) but Haven't found any which will allow me to use their cars (I'm 21 with driving license for 3 years).

Here is my rough plan. I’m hoping to take a large chunk of time off within the next 1-2 years to do some long term traveling/backpacking. Unfortunately I’m not in the financial position to do that due to mistakes when I was younger. I want to stick it out with my job for the next year until I’m in a good position to do it. 

I gain 3 weeks of vacation next year. My original thought is it may be better to do a couple of 4-5 day extended weekend trips instead of just blowing a week or 2 straight through. So I can see multiple destinations and more frequently. 

I’m located just outside of NYC, I’m 24, and I’m open to going almost anywhere! I was thinking of Costa Rica, Tulum, and a few places in Canada. I really want to go to Japan and Europe but I’m unsure if it’s worth all the time traveling there to only spend a couple of days.

sonicruiser,jiccxe,"8,000 miles in 2 weeks","In April of next year, I have to drive to Tucson for some work/business purposes. So assuming a baseline, I will have to drive to Arizona and back at the bare minimum for this trip. I have wanted to do a long solo road trip across the US landscapes for some time. I have enough vacation days to take approximately 10-11 days off on top of 3-4 days for my work in Tucson. So assuming that, I will have about 2 weeks to do this trip give or take a few days. My estimates say that just the driving part of this trip will take 120-150 hrs. So I will budget a week for just driving. That leaves me with the other week for my work in Tucson and any stops I make, so it will probably be a split of 3-4 days in Tucson and 3-4 days of sightseeing in various cities/parks across the US for a combined total of 7 days of non-driving. This trip from end to end will be roughly 8,000 miles. I will be driving to Arizona no matter what due to work, but I would like to see more of the western US by road as it is meant to be seen. The longest drive I have done before is Tampa-El Paso-Tampa so this will be quite a bit longer than that. I am fully aware that this trip will be very tolling on the body, but it should also be the adventure of a lifetime.  Any advice on travel tips or what to see along the way is greatly appreciated. With that in mind, here is the planned route:

Tampa-Dallas

Dallas-Tucson

Tucson-Phoenix

Phoenix-Grand Canyon

Grand Canyon-Los Angeles

Los Angeles-San Francisco

San Francisco-Sacramento

deliveryboyman,jig6tg,Mexico - Dia de Muertos 2021,"Usually this time a year I try to flee my cold and dark home here in Europe to somewhere sunny and warm. Since this years plans got canceled by the pandemic I thought I'd get a head start on next year - in the hope that we've got everything under control by then.

Mexico has been on top of my to-go list for some time now, so I started to plan the following trip for the end of October/beginning of November:
* Mexico City: 5 Days, including a day trip to Teotihuacán
* Puebla: 2 Days
* Oaxaca: 4 Days, during the festivities


I'm planning on travelling domestically by bus, are there any other stops along my route you would suggest? Are two days in Puebla too little time? Also, if you have recommendations on where to stay in those places I'd be glad to hear them!

As for Dia de Muertos in Oaxaca, I found a trip on G-Adventures which covers that part of my trip and would also add a few days in Puerto Escondido. Since it's very reasonably priced and I've also read some positive reviews on G-Adventores on here I'm thinking about booking that. If anyone here travelled with them in Mexico I'd be happy about some reviews.

Finally a somewhat cultural question. Where I'm from All Saints Day is a rather private holiday. You visit the graves of family and friends, which have been decorated the days before, but it would be rather strange to have tourists there. From what I've read online that's quite different for Dia de Muertos - as long as you behave and dress accordingly it's fine to visit the graveyards. Any locals or people that have been in Mexico for Dia de Muertos here that wanna chime in? I just want to make sure I don't offend anyone while im there.",solotravel,1603724748

For me it's the La Linea crossing into Spain. Inside the border post there were a set of automated gates, and a manual counter. I instinctively went to the automated gates, thinking that like a normal border post these would be faster, only to find they are not turned on. Only then did I notice everyone was going to the manual counter. I went up and tried to hand over my passport. The official glanced at the cover, didn't even take it, and waved me through. :o

**Strictest border crossing:**

Macau by far. I got a pat-down search by officials before I boarded the ferry, this was even stricter than flying, so I had a feeling things wouldn't be easy.

And I was right, as soon as I stepped off the ferry, I got taken into a holding room. Three or four officials started questioning me: what are you doing here, where did you go before, how much cash I had on me (and can they photograph the cash?), what are the names and occupation of my parents, where will I be staying etc etc. They asked to see my travel photos and my social media apps.

After a round of questioning they took me into a second holding room, with a dozen other people awaiting processing.

When I was 25 I went travelling with my girlfriend of the time to Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, India, Sri Lanka and Nepal for a yearlong trip. I cycled through most of SE Asia and hitchiked through Malaysia. 

6 years on and I got married and had a baby as I always planned to do. That trip has changed me forever though and I still think of something from it every day. Never has there been another year in my life which I can remember so well.

Anyway I plan to retire at 55 and I have told my wife from the start that I plan to go away to do some proper travelling again. We often take city breaks in Europe together and we visit her home country of Japan once a year or so. 

Her idea of a great holiday is the perfect hotel room and complete comfort. I want to see more chaos and dirt.

I am considering cycling through South America or maybe getting a motorbike and doing more or perhsps just travelling to all those far flung places with a backpack.

I guess my question is do you think this is a morally OK thing to do? My daughter will be in her twenties and my wife is very independent, I was also thinking she could meet me for breaks in some countries.

My other question is, what is it like travelling at that age? I am very into keeping fit and if luck is on my side hopefully I will still have my health at that age. What is it really like being the old guy at the hostel?

mordor958,jkf0er,"I feel that I'm getting too comfortable with the 9-5 life, and that it's going to be difficult to long term travel again.","So bit of backstory, I made [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/g85w4p/ive_come_to_a_decision_on_what_to_do_once_this/) about 6 months ago. From that point, I've found a very well paying job, as well as an incredibly affordable living situation. With the current state of affairs of the world, I am still shooting to leave in late 2021 for a 12-18 month trip around the world.   


What makes me nervous is I'm getting too comfortable with my 9-5 job life, I am making quite a bit more than I thought I would be, so I'm saving 3x more for my trip then I need. I like my job, and really like my relaxing life right now. With the rate I'm saving, I could literally pay off all of my student loans within 12 months.  Given quarantine, I am spending quite a bit more time and money on my home space, and frankly on the year leading up to my initial trip, I was minimalizing my possessions so it would be easier to leave everything behind. I feel comfortable hanging out at home all day now, I love to travel but right now my home office feels relaxing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go on this grand adventure around the world, I want to do something that most people in American society will never have the opportunity to do. I want to see how much a 12+ month trip will change me as a person, but I'm getting nervous that when the time comes to send in my resignation, I won't be able to do it. I had so much energy and excitement to leave in May 2020, but since that didn't happen and I don't know how long it's going to be until I can leave now, I don't know how to target my energy?

Doing a lot of travelling is a big goal of mine but I also don't want to stay at home any longer; I want to be independent.

However, I'm grappling with the idea of having to choose - I feel like moving out is a commitment (even though I've been to uni before) that will impede my ability to travel to the extent that I want to. I want this long trip then to have the ability to travel frequently as well but I've got nagging thoughts about it like   
\- What about paying rent I'm away, urely I won't be able to afford both?  
\- I could just move back with family briefly around travelling but if I move out i can't keep just going back and forth,  
\- If I just fuck it, move out and go travelling for a while, then come back, will I just be able to move back with friends again or will I need to move back with family?

jtrom1010,jkknwc,1 Week in Peru: May 2021,"Hey friends! 

First and foremost, in case you didn't see it, Budget Air is pushing an AeroMexico deal that got me roundtrip from SLC&gt;LIM for **$267.** No idea about other departure hubs, but I'd imagine it's not JUST for SLC, so yeah. Don't say you weren't told. 

Anywho, I've got essentially a full week in Peru (something like 9 days to pad travel and have an actual, full week) for May of 2021. 

I have done some decent research and basically came to the idea that I should do a 60/40 or 70/30 ish time split between Cusco and Lima, with Cusco getting more time. 

Of COURSE, I want to see Machu Picchu, and I do love the outdoors in my own right (I currently live in Salt Lake) but that will probably be a 1-2 day thing for me, rather than the full 4-5 day Inca Trail. 

I am a big fan of hostel life, nightlife (although I like local dives more than clubs), and just generally interesting places to wander. Do you think my split is appropriate? I've heard Lima can be underwhelming, and was considering not bothering for more than a full day or so and just heading right over to Cusco and surrounding. Basically, making it a trip to Cusco with a layover in Lima.  

Any hostel recommendations, general thoughts on the itinerary, etc.?

**Tl;dr possible itinerary:**

Travel days excluded\*  
Day 1: Lima exploration and lots of food, night out

Day 2: Basically the same

Day 3: Leave for Cusco and explore area around my hostel

Day 4: Machu Picchu 

Day 5: Maybe MP again or more Cusco hangs

Day 6: One of the day trips around Cusco 

Day 7: Back to Lima, hang out until flight the next day.

CenturyOldMilk,iygln5,Never Booking With Booking.com Book Directly,"I had booked about two months in advance for a trip I had planned to Monterrey/Big Sur for mid September. As the date approached for the trip wildfires started to break out around the area around mid August. These fires were bad and were making air quality horrible and were getting close to the hotel we were staying at. It was counterintuitive to stay somewhere so close to the fires only to just stay indoors the whole time, or worst get stuck out there 2-3 hours away from home.  


Although our stay was still a few weeks away, I made the decision to try to cancel the booking because there was no sign the fires would let up, they did not let up even on the date of our booking. I couldn't have known that and the hotel/booking.com couldn't have known that either, but judging on how bad the fires were and still are, they refused to refund my money.  


The property we were staying at told us specifically that we had to deal with booking.com in order to get our refund. Upon contacting them they then told us that we had to deal with the property directly in order to get our refund. This back and forth lasted for a good hour. That's not an exaggeration. An hour of back and forth trying to reason with booking.com. The property made it clear that on their end, they had not received any payment and that since I booked with a third party (booking.com), they were the ones responsible in issuing me a refund. Even if the property wanted to they couldn't refund me money they hadn't received.  


Making this very clear to the handful of representatives at booking.com that ""assisted"" me, they insisted that the property was the one responsible in issuing me my refund. You can see how infuriating it is when all they did was throw their hands up and tried to shoe me away when clearly stating to them there was no money to return on the property's behalf. They stated that because the property did not clear the transaction they had nothing to give back to me. So my question is now, current day, where did my money go? Of course to booking.com.  


I am now out the money I paid for a reservation we never attended and despite filing a claim they still won the case and kept my money. Stay far away from booking.com. I'm not sure how it is getting refunded with other third party booking agencies, but definitely do not book with booking.com. Whatever money you think you're saving it's not worth it. Just book directly with the property and save yourself the frustration and financial stress of giving your money to a company whose interest is not with the customer but with their own pockets.",solotravel,1600887746

PiBrickShop,iynwgy,Trip report - solo road trip - Minnesota to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks,"Here is my trip report, driving from Minneapolis to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, Sept. 11 through Sept. 18, 2020. I am a solo traveler on this trip, driving my Kia Optima, camping in a tent, and eating food that I’m bringing along. I’m a married father of two girls, and this is my first major solo trip. I visited YNP with my wife and kids last summer, and haven’t been to GTNP since I was about age 3. 

DAY 1 - FRIDAY. Plan: Drive home to Teddy Roosevelt NP

Had to switch to Plan B immediately after leaving the house because Beartooth Pass was still closed when I left home. So reversed my route and driving toward the Bighorn Mountains instead. Drove 830 miles in 13 hours from Minneapolis area to Ten Sleep, WY. Took the loop through Badlands NP in South Dakota and bought my annual pass. Camped at Ten Sleep RV Park, and walked to Ten Sleep Brewing for an evening beer. Saw one cow moose in the Bighorns.

DAY 2 - SATURDAY. Plan: Drive Ten Sleep to Cooke City, MT

Making it all the way to Ten Sleep on day 1 allowed me to take my time getting to Cooke City, where I had a reservation at the Alpine Hotel (no camping due to bears). Departed Ten Sleep at 7am. Drove east back through Ten Sleep Canyon to see it going the other way. Then north to Sheridan, WY for a grocery stop. Next was back through the Bighorns on 14 to 14A, another amazing drive! Checked into the Alpine Hotel, and then headed into YNP for wolf viewing in the evening. Headed to Slough Creek and waited for wolves for two hours, but none were around. Headed back toward Cooke City, and found the Butte Junction wolves (and group of people) there. There were also two grizzly bear right with the wolves, with one wolf following each grizzly. The wolf and grizzly would interact occasionally, it was really neat!

DAY 3 - SUNDAY. Plan: Hike, Mammoth, Hike, end at Madison Campground

Left Cooke City at 615am. Watched the Junction Butte wolfpack again in Lamar Valley. Hiked to Hellroaring Creek, 4.32 miles RT (excellent hike with meadows, woods, ascents and descents). Hiked Mammoth Hot Springs including walking the driving loop, 3.76 miles total. Hiked the Norris Geyser Basin, 2.49 miles total. Drove Firehole Lake Drive, saw White Dome Geyser erupt. Drove out to West Yellowstone to get gas and to call my wife. On the way, watched a bull elk and his ~20 cows along the Madison River. Checked into my campsite at Madison Campground for 2 nights there. I was starting to get a bit tired, but it was too early to stay at camp, so I went for a short drive. I’m so glad I did! At Madison Junction in the Gibbon River, there was a crowd watching something, and I caught a glimpse of a moose heading into the woods. I stopped, and for the next two hours I followed the bull moose and two cows (from a safe distance of course). They stayed in the woods for a while, but I knew they would head back to the river, and eventually they did. They put on a great show! Be sure to watch the video in my album, it was a trip highlight!

DAY 4 - MONDAY. Plan: Hike, tour, geyser watch in YNP

Left Madison at 7am. Drove to Old Faithful area, and watched OF at 745am with just a handful of people. From there, hiked to Mallard Lake, 7.75 miles RT (nice hike with no other people). Walked the Upper Geyser Basin – saw Grand Geyser, Daisy, Lion (twice), OF from Beehive. Then I took a break in the car because Riverside was predicted in about 2.5 hours. As I sat in my car, I watched herds of people and cars, and got frustrated – all of that commotion wasn’t what I wanted. Did some research and found a backup – hiked up Purple Mountain, 6.49 miles RT (challenging climb, great view, few people). Drove Firehole Canyon Drive, and took a dip in the river. Drove to Grand Prismatic in the evening, but there were so many people still there so I didn’t stop.

DAY 5 - TUESDAY. Plan: Drive to GTNP, get campsite, hike to Delta Lake

Left Madison at 640am, and drove toward GTNP via Canyon and Hayden Valley. Saw 5 elk including two bulls, all of them were solo. In GTNP, stopped at Mormon Row and the TA Moulton barn. Drove to Gros Ventre to get a campsite. I waited in line for about 30 minutes, and finally got a site for 3 nights at about 10am. Headed out for the hike of the day – Lupine Meadows TH to Delta Lake. 8.5 miles RT, 2457 feet elevation gain. Fun, challenging hike, with an amazing view at the end, but Delta Lake is no “secret” hike. Then relaxed at the campsite in the evening.

DAY 6 - WEDNESDAY. Plan: Hike Cascade Canyon to Lake Solitude

Depart Gros Ventre at 605am headed to String Lake TH. Hiked String Lake, through Cascade Canyon, to Lake Solitude, and back. 16.79 miles total with 2670 feet of elevation gain. This was an AMAZING hike! I loved it so much – the views in the North Fork toward Lake Solitude are wonderful. Spent about an hour at Lake Solitude enjoying the scenery, ate lunch, saw a fox trot along the lake, and I swam to the small wooded island! The water was so cold but so energizing. In the evening, relaxed at the campsite, and walked around Gros Ventre campground – 2.71 miles total.

DAY 7 - THURSDAY. Plan: Hike Paintbrush Canyon to Holly Lake

Depart Gros Ventre at 6am toward String Lake TH. Hiked Paintbrush Canyon, and continued up toward Paintbrush Divide because I wanted to get over 10,000 ft. elevation. Paintbrush Canyon was really neat, and a different type of hike than Cascade Canyon. I saw one black bear, and a bull elk with two cows. Once over 10,000, I figured I should just go up to the Divide. After I got over the small glacier and saw the final ascent and evaluated my water situation, I decided not to go up to the Divide. Headed back down to destination #2, Holly Lake. Jumped into Holly Lake and talked to 4 other hikers there for a while, then returned to String Lake. 16.42 miles total, 3562 foot elevation gain. Afterward, I got my only restaurant food of the trip – a takeout pizza from Dornans, and it was really good. In the evening, relaxed at the campsite, took a dip/rinse in the Gros Ventre river, and walked along the Gros Ventre river and saw one cow moose.

DAY 8 - FRIDAY. Plan: Drive toward home including Beartooth Pass

Depart Gros Ventre at 6am. Drove north through YNP, exited NE entrance. Saw a few elk, many bison (duh!), a coyote in Lamar Valley. Drove over Beartooth Pass (saw three mountain goats), had a beer at Red Lodge Alex, and made it to Medora, ND Red Trail Campground at 7pm.
DAY 9 - SATURDAY. Plan: Drive TRNP and to home
Depart Red Trail Campground at 615am. Drove through Teddy Roosevelt NP for a while (saw wild turkey, prairie dogs, a lot of mule deer including four bucks). Then headed home, arriving here at 5pm.

SUMMARY:

On the trip, I really wanted to focus on good and challenging hikes away from the crowds, and I found that! The parks were very busy and popular parking spots were over-crowded. Getting just a mile or so away from the roads pays dividends! I also wanted to see wildlife, and wildlife cooperated.

The weather was amazing. Fire haze would settle in every day – mornings started out clear and it generally got hazier at the day went on. High temps were 75-80, lows at night 30-35, very little wind.

While driving, I listened to a lot of podcasts, which seemed to make the driving go much faster than music. 

Thank you for reading! I’d love to answer any questions. I could provide a lot more commentary, but don’t want to bore everyone. In the end, amazing trip, and I really want to do more mountain hiking and would like to do a backcountry trip.",solotravel,1600912378

onemanmelee,iz0kvi,Covid-era Travel,"Hey all, 

So this falls somewhere between totally stupid and totally smart. 

Obviously covid is everywhere, but in many places globally it is dying down. As the risk of catching it seems to at least be lower now, and travel prices being insanely low, is now, or late this year/early next year, maybe a great time to do some extended traveling?

I know it is a risk from a health perspective, and also many places may still have lockdown measures where not everything is open for business, or quarantine measures that could complicate things, but it seems like that could be worked around. Especially as a solo traveler who is not typically prone to going to concerts or clubs or etc when vacationing. I mean, you'll still be able to roam the cities and wilderness, and hopefully some museums et al will be partially open. 

I feel like it's a risk in terms of getting covid and also in visiting half-closed cities, but also a possible chance to do traveling in a rare instance where everything is super duper discounted.  I had a friend who flew cross country for $60. That's usually like a $400 flight, maybe even more. 

And social distancing isn't hard for me. I'd be mostly walking around cities, lounging on beaches, etc. 

There is also the caveat that I am American, and we're still banned from many countries, but hoping that dies down within the coming months.

What are your thoughts on this? Are any of you planning to take advantage of this odd time? I feel like not only will prices return to normal, but may be jacked up once lockdowns have ended, because so many people will be dying for a getaway.",solotravel,1600965212

-RaisedByWolves-,izmxq0,How to travel across Asia? (in 2021),"Hello fellow travellers. I have no doubt this question has been posted here before. 

I’m planning on traveling as much of Asia as humanly possible in 2021 (if the corona situation is better) for about 6 months or longer if possible.

I’ve got 15,000 USD with me but I was wondering what the best route would be to take? I plan to do a lot of the traveling on the ground as opposed to flights. I’ll take a flight only if I have to, but I have all the time in the world so I don’t mind long train/bus/bike journeys. 

In terms of what I’m doing, I don’t have much of a plan. I’d like to just explore most of the countries, off the beaten path type of thing. Mainly looking for the best routes from country to country. 

Would love some help from someone who has either done it before, or someone who knows their way around a map geographically. 

And any advice would be appreciated. I’ve been to Asia a few times before but this is the longest/most ambitious trip I’ll be doing in my life. Thanks!",solotravel,1601052160
reginafilange89,izng6t,Where did your wanderlust come from?,"During Covid I'm taking some time to reflect why I am getting so crazy being cooped up in 1 place. Where did all that wanderlust come from? Is my desire to travel only driven by social media and blogs? I would love to hear where yours come from.

After some reflections I realise a lot of mine just came from my nature and childhood experience. 

Since 7 yrs old ( mid 90s') I often travel with my sport team to other provinces to compete. Air travel was not popular back then, so we mainly travel by train, and in case you didn't already know, train travelling through Vietnam is one of the best rides in the whole world. The scenery always excited me, and I couldn't stop dreaming of jumping out of train alone to experience the landscape, to climb down the cliffs to touch the ocean, to walk among the endless lush forests and hills, to sample all the weird dishes by the vendors at every station in every province.

My dad also had a globe and I often fantasized being in different parts of the world, and back in the 90s information and imageries were scarce, so my imagination of the world was actually very different from reality.

Being in a new strange place always excited me more than scaring me. During middle school I sometimes cycled 20km to the border of my city and that alone gave my the thrills.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I can now understand that my decision to travel was largely innerself-driven rather being influenced by marketing. I would also urge my fellow travellers to think about what drives you, so that you may find the experiences that truly make you happy when travelling :)",solotravel,1601053738
zoink001100,izruht,A literary tidbit I thought I should share.,"I know Americans can't go anywhere at the moment. And it vexes me. I'm reading The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson, one of my favorite authors, and came across this passage:

""She had never driven far alone before. The notion of dividing her lovely journey into miles and hours was silly; she saw it, bringing her car with precision between the line on the road and the line of trees beside the road, as a passage of moments, each one new, carrying her along with them, taking her down a path of incredible novelty to a new place. The journey itself was her positive action, her destination vague, unimagined, perhaps nonexistent. She meant to savor each turn of her traveling, loving the road and the trees and the houses and the small ugly towns, teasing herself with the notion that she might take it into her head to stop just anywhere and never leave again. She might pull her car to the side of the highway—although that was not allowed, she told herself, she would be punished if she really did—and leave it behind while she wandered off past the trees into the soft, welcoming country beyond. She might wander till she was exhausted, chasing butterflies or following a stream, and then come at nightfall to the hut of some poor woodcutter who would offer her shelter; she might make her home forever in East Barrington or Desmond or the incorporated village of Berk; she might never leave the road at all, but just hurry on and on until the wheels of the car were worn to nothing and she had come to the end of the world. ""

It vexes me, not being able to travel.",solotravel,1601067321

I think most people would agree Las Vegas or Niagara Falls (the city in Niagara Falls) isn't authentic.  
I think most people would agree going to that country for enough time to learn the language &amp; make some local friends would be as authentic as it gets.

For me - I like to live with locals where I go (which is why I like Airbnb, or trying to convince a friend of a friend to host me), &amp; avoid those places that host tons of tourists (think those party hostels).

3. There were incidences of tourists being robbed on even the most popular trails.

rakuu,j0cx96,My #1 travel advice: Wake up early,"I really don't like being in crowds, and I'm guessing most of you don't either.  The easiest way to avoid crowds is just to wake up early.  

You can have a very leisurely morning breakfast, go for a nice long walk alone in a very picturesque neighborhood or park, go see some busy sights if you want to, and then have an early lunch when restaurants aren't busy and the food is freshest. I'm also self-conscious when eating alone in most busy restaurants, but I don't care at all when there's hardly anyone else eating.  

I just saw a post in r/travel where someone said it's impossible to avoid pictures with ridiculous crowds at the Great Wall of China.  Well, I just woke up early, and walked nearly the entire public section of Mutianyu very leisurely before anyone else showed up except a couple vendors setting up for the day.  https://imgur.com/gallery/mTiiYYg

Then I often take a break in the early afternoon when everyone else is crowding transit and cafes and restaurants and shops and sights and cool neighborhoods -- eg, laying in a park, the beach, back in my room doing some planning, hostel common area, etc.  Then in late afternoon/early evening I like to visit places that opened later and have usually slowed down -- shops, teahouses, cafes, markets, art galleries, etc.  Then again, have an early dinner while food is freshest, service is fast, and there's hardly anyone else there.

What about nightlife and drinking?  Well, I haven't really drunk much since my first year or so of traveling.  Of course drinking is a highlight for a lot of travelers, but honestly I'd rather drink at home.  If there's a type of drink or nightlife experience I'd like -- again, I'll go early at night when again there are fewer people and faster service.  I've also found that it's a lot easier to meet and have conversations earlier on, especially local folk.  Obviously I don't go hard partying much, but once in a while I'll stay out late and wake up later.

I'm not a ""morning person"" at all at home.  I woke up at 10:30am this morning for example.  But, I find it a lot easier traveling since I'm usually exhausted and a little jet lagged the first day anyway, and it's easier to reset my schedule to go to bed &amp; wake up early.  I've never been able to convince travel partners to do this with me, and I'm more likely to stay out late with other travel partners, but going solo it's easy.

Anyone else have experience with successes waking up early while traveling?",solotravel,1601151096

takkamilblog,j0gs4y,Living Under $300 a Month in Poland,"Living Under $300 a Month in Poland

So it all basically started when I had to move back to my Grandparents place. I was low on money, low on self-esteem, and life had fatigued me to the point that I needed a break from everything and everyone. It didn't really go as I expected though, living with my Grandparents was an emotional roller coaster, but I survived and eventually rented a room in a bigger city nearby. The rent cost me around $300, that's including the deposit. But as soon as I made the transition I knew that money was low and I had to be very careful with where and how I spent my money.

With around 150 USD in my account left I knew that I had to be very frugal with my spendings otherwise I wouldn't be able to pay next month's rent, but living in difficult situations in the past gave me some courage though. 

So the first step was to figure out what I needed money for, I kind of had to design my life based of my current financial situation.

""First thing, I want to eat healthy, so I'll probably stick with a Vegetarian diet, I also want to go out to Cafes once or twice a week for a coffee, and maybe travel on the Weekends. I got to pay 150 USD for rent every month, and I make around 250 USD every month so that means I got $100 to spend for the whole month - meaning $25 for each week. Now... how the fuck can I do that?""

I knew that living this way was going to be tough. First thing was that I needed to cook in bulk that way I would be able to feed myself for the entire week and this way I could save money by not eating out. There were already pots and pans in the house so that save me a bit of money. And I might have to push back the Weekened trips for now until I find more work.

So ""Week One"" began. I bought in bulk, only buying essentials. I figured out that I could probably cook a curry dish for cheap. Just needed a bunch of vegetables, curry powder, few other spices, tomato sauce as the base, and maybe throw in some beans or chikapeas to get those proteins. I also bought a few cans of tuna bc they had olive oil in them, and eggs so that I could get my meat nutrients covered. So did all of that, had the groceries all in my basket. I was expecting to buy food for at least 5 days, but I'm sure I had more, or it just felt like it. Some guy in the line commented 

""ohh you're buying food for the whole week, huh?""

""yeah gotta eat man""

Lady started scanning the items, I was hoping to pay under 40 usd.

""What is your biedronka card number?""

""blah blah blah blah blah blah""

""It will be 96 zl""

'oh shit. that's pretty good' I thought to myself. That's like 20 usd dollars.

""Alright I will pay with card""

Peep

I loaded all the items into my backpack and an extra bag I bought, Jesus it was heavy, and went off home.

""See you later""

I had about 5 usd left, which could be used for coffee or tea. Coffee where I live cost usually around 2 - 3 usd, so twice a week I could go for coffee.

Came home, cut up the vegetables, threw them in the big orange pot (like those ones that your Grandma has), popped the tuna and drained the Olive oil in the pot, I let it cook for 10 minutes, then I threw in the tomato sauce, the beans and the spices. I let it simmer for a good 20 to 30 minutes and it was all ready. I also forgot to mention that I bought rice, which only cost about 1 dollar for a pound. Washed it, put it on the stove and also let it simmer for a good 20 minutes.

I realised that I had a whole pot of food. It was HUGE. Enough for at least 5 days, but it lasted me 6 days. I had a small breakfast, and two medium sized meals for M, T, W, Th, F, and Sa, which was perfect for me. On Sundays I would just eat something light, maybe some fruits or whatever was left over. 
I followed this routine for a few weeks, buying just the essentials. After the third week I started to make a bit more money because I was working as a freelance designer, so sometimes I get a project that pays a bit. So now my groceries cost me just under $30 (per week) because I buy maybe some extra tuna or some snacks.

Let's not forget that I wanted to travel during the Weekends so that I wasn't too bored where I lived. The city that I stay in is a fairly populated city, with just under 200,000 people, but lots of these people are kids and old ladies. It's a very family oriented city, you can walk one block and you will probably see a mother with her stroller.

Now that I'm making a bit more money online, I still don't splurge. When I travel I pay around 10 usd for a round way ticket to a bigger city nearby called Krakow, and adding accomodation for a night or two costs me around 10 - 20usd, and when I travel I try not to eat out, maybe I grab a coffee here or there, but I try to be frugal.

So in total, nowadays I'm spending under $300 for a whole months of eating really good homemade meals, breakfast, lunch and dinner, having a coffee once or twice a week, and getting to travel on the Weekends to the bigger city for free events or meetups that interest me. And during some Weekends my friends travel to Krakow so I just crash on their couch to save a bit on accommodation. This seems pretty low-budget to me for the type of Lifestyle I'm living.

And people might ask

""Why are you doing that?""

Well my perspective in this moment is I don't want to be stuck in the rat race, I'm at a point where I had enough and it's time for me to get out and actually build a company of my own. I see it in a way that we're given these two resources of, energy and time. And if you're working a regular job yes you'll make money, but you'll be spending a lot of your time doing something repetitive and 'most likely' something you don't like doing, and so you're trading your energy and time, just so that you can make a bit and get by. And that 'bit', the money, can be used as a leverage to pull yourself out of the rat race, or it can be something that just digs you deeper into the rat race. So I try to use the money that I make (and even though it's not so much at the moment) as a resource to invest into my feature, rather than spending it on temporary pleasures like alcohol or such things. But I'm not saying ""don't spend at all"", you should definitely reward yourself for hard work, I do. 

So that's all I got for now. Hope this was useful to you.

swingingpendulums,j0j55c,Trip report - 2 weeks (mostly) solo traveling around Costa Rica,"I have just finished 16 days travelling around the beautiful country of Costa Rica. Here is my trip report on what I did, and some tips for anyone planning something similar in the future. 

**Part 1 - Playa Guiones**

The first section of my trip was spent in the Nicoya Peninsula in NW Costa Rica. I stayed in the pretty sweet little town of Playa Guiones. It had some decent restaurants and is great if you like surfing. There aren't any hostels here to speak of, so AirBNB it was. The main reason I was here was to see the [turtles in Ostional](https://mytanfeet.com/costa-rica-national-park/ostional-wildlife-refuge-protecting-turtles/). It was a pretty awesome experience. The Olive Ridley turtles come on the beach (en-mass) to nest a few times every year. To see the number of turtles on this one beach at 5am was a pretty special experience. Interestingly, the turtles are pretty solitary creatures out at sea and only come onto the beach to lay their eggs, before returning to life alone. 

**Note on turtles:**

Best to visit early in the morning to have the best chance of seeing them. The cost to get in was approx. $20 which goes towards the conservation of these turtles. It is one of only 2 places in the world that this event happens so if you're in the area (and it is happening), I really recommend it. 

**Part 2 - Santa Teresa**

Next, I visited the small town of Santa Teresa on the southern coast of the peninsula. Unfortunately, there are no buses from the North-South of the peninsula. The only option from Playa Guiones is PG - Nicoya - Puntarenas - ferry to Paquera - bus to Cobano - bus to Santa Teresa. Should take you about 14 hours to do what could be a 3-hour drive. In ST, I stayed in the super nice [Luz de Luna](http://luzdelunahotel.com/). The place is run by a really cool Belgian guy and has these amazing little huts overlooking a great jungle garden. Seeing monkeys in the evening was pretty sweet! Here I didn't do a huge amount except explore the local area. There are ATVs that you can rent in the main town and there are loads of tide pools along the coast which are pretty cool to swim in. Again, this is a good place if you enjoy surfing! (Or yoga). 

**Part 3 - Puerto Viejo de Talamanca**

I then did a very long trip from Santa Teresa to Puerto Viejo de Limon (on the Caribbean coast). I spent a night in San José just to break up the journey. This was by far my favourite part of the whole couple of weeks. I really liked the Caribbean food (way spicier than what I was getting on the Pacific coast) and there was a lot more going on. I stayed in the pretty awesome [Rocking J's hostel](https://www.rockingjs.com/). Thanks to many recommendations on here for that! The hammocks were super cheap ($5 p/n) and the staff were super chill. The location is great - 30 second walk to the beach! Here, I mainly ate loads of awesome Caribbean chicken and fish + went to the amazing [Gandoca Manzanillo wildlife refuge](https://www.google.com/search?q=manzanillo+reserve&amp;oq=manzanillo+reserve&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.5640j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) where I saw loads of toucans, macaws, sloths + loads more monkeys. To get there, I hired a bicycle from Rocking J's and cycled the 13 or so km. Apart from that, I also did quite a bit of snorkelling in the sea off Rocking J's and met some pretty cool people!

I had a quick question about picking a phone plan when I take my trip. I expect to be gone about a year and a half, so obviously I'll need a phone with data.

My two options are below:

1. Google fi - I have enough people interested that I can get the family plan and pay $45/month for unlimited data, talk, and text (data is all I care about though)

Pros:
* I get to keep my same number without having to port it over to Google voice
* Nearly worldwide coverage
* No need to get a new sim card every time I switch to another country
* Unlimited data

Cons:
* It's not very popular yet and I can't seem to find reviews from travelers
* Price, while decent, is a bit high. I'll be traveling mostly in Latin America, so I'm sure I can find cheaper plans.

Option 2. Use my unlocked phone and stick a sim card in with a new plan every time I go to another country. I'd import my number to Google voice so as long as I have data, I'll be able to talk and text with people back home without a hassle.

Pros:
* Potentially cheaper
* More options for service providers

Cons:
* It will be a hassle to switch sim cards every time I enter a new country
* I'm not sure if unlimited data plans really exist in Latin America.

I'm honestly leaning towards option one due to sheer convenience, but want to know if anyone here has experience with the service.

Also, the cost of an unlimited data plan with local carriers would be a factor into my decision. Anyone have any sort of data for an unlimited plan in, say, Mexico? Maybe on Claro o Movistar?

Small_Race6991,j1514f,Any advice for achieving a final goal of living/managing a business abroad?,"Advice for achieving a final goal of living/managing a business abroad?

I have lots of travel experience and have worked as a tour guide, ESL teacher, and event coordinator. I lived in Thailand for a year, and have moved around a lot and backpacked long-term. My dream is to move abroad (after travelling around more and finding a place I want to commit to) and eventually either own or manage my own business- a hostel, cafe, event space, or ESL school (preferably, a more multi-purpose space that can be used for many of these things!)

cerebro_tonic,j174lr,Is it normal to feel uncomfortable staying in a hostel during Covid or maybe I have outgrown hostels?,"30 year old guy here. I've solo travelled quite a few times. Not as much as many experienced travellers but enough that I am comfortable doing it and I enjoy it.

Generally, I've been fine staying in hostels. However, I recently arrived in Krakow and it just feels really uncomfortable being in a hostel right now. It's quite a party-oriented hostel and there's like six of us in the room. Couple of the guys there are coughing and it smells.

Turning 30 was a big deal mentally in terms of evaluating my life and what I've done. In truth, I have many regrets and I didn't live the party lifestyle that many twentysomethings do, especially when it comes to solo travel. Part of me is wondering whether this discomfort in the hostel is just the hard-hitting feeling that I will never live that life.

I've tried to convince myself 30 isn't too old to go to new cities, stay in cheap hostels and get drunk. But I'm starting to think it is.

On the other hand, maybe it's just normal to feel uneasy in a hostel setting in the current situation? Just looking for some input or advice. Thanks.",solotravel,1601275215

I have 3 places in my mind so far and would like your opinion and other recommendations:

1) Berlin: planning to spend 1.5 months here, while still exploring other cities in Germany such as Hamburg, Münich and other ""smaller"" cities. I have a very huge passion for Germany, its history and language. So I may extend the stay here.

2)Rome: Planning to also spend 1.5 months here. I chose Rome because I hear it is underrated and there are LOTS of stuff to do. There are other cities such as Milan and Venice that are also competing for this spot, your input here would be greatly appreciated ;).

3) Paris: Also 1.5 months. Obviously, Paris is the most well known city in Europe ( if not the world lol), but I was wondering are there any other suggestions for French cities to spend at least a month there?

Since a few weeks I’ve been exploring on Reddit and a few of its subreddits, especially the Reddits about vanlife, traveling and the outdoors. I’m not really the big talker so the fact that I feel like sharing a bit of my story is quite interesting to me. The core of this post will be about the insights I’ve had while traveling and what the vanlife has brought me so far. I feel like there is a lot of doubt when it comes to committing to the vanlife for a longer period of time. Maybe this can be a bit of a help for those who are considering a personal vanlife expedition. I think a little backstory would be best, however if you want to just have a quick sense about it, feel free to skip to the end or just watch the images. Being born and rooted in Flanders, my native language is Dutch. So, pardon me for my English, I’ll do my best.

**Background**

My name is Floris, 27 years old and I’m living in my van since January 2020, together with my dog Sauron. I graduated as a social worker and worked for 4,5 years in a youth community development project. In short I was responsible for developing a healthy community/culture in a rather tough neighborhood. Building trust, bringing the youth together and support them in taking the ‘driving wheel’ of their own neighborhood and free time in a good way were the key aspects of my job. Aside from that I was a reference point for all the youth and their network. Any question would be good and most of their questions circled around education, work, drugs or were neighborhood related.

In my free time I was and still am very passionate about Wing Chun, Taiji, MMA, hiking, being in the outdoors and spending time with my friends. I’ve always been pretty busy in sports but for the last 8 years it has been purely martial arts, mainly Wing Chun. Aside from that I really love special beers and weed. In fact I’ve been smoking weed daily for the past 10 years and during the 4,5 years I was working I also drank some beers every evening. I didn’t drink until I was drunk but still every evening like 6 - 7 beers. Those years were great but there was also an inner voice calling “ Is this routine how you are going to spend all of your time from now on?”.

When I was around one year into my employment the urge began to grow to experience a completely empty schedule. Or rather no schedule at all, just go with the flow. To be totally free for the first time. No school stuff that you have to do to get your degree, no meetings for work that you have to be at to earn money to pay the bills and my lifestyle, nothing\*\*... How would I spend my time when I was totally free and on my own?\*\* That urge grew and grew and one year later when I had a vacation and went hiking in France it became clear to me that I just had to go for it, I would not forgive myself otherwise. I did some thinking and gave myself 2 years to finish my projects at work and save enough money to buy a van and gather some travel money. In those 2 years my plan would keep on getting more and more refined.

**The travelplan/Ikigai**

As I said I’ve been practicing Kung Fu for almost 10 years. Not in a constant manner, more in like a wave frequency. There were months where I trained weekly, other months daily, a month almost nothing and so on. However the passion never fades and YouTube knew that very well. It kept feeding me lots of Kung Fu from masters around the world. Some things I saw I just couldn’t believe, especially when it comes to the more internal skills like certain Taiji Masters showcase. I started to put dots on the map: who are those masters and where can I find them? And so a first kind of route developed. That combined with my passion for mountains and beautiful nature in general made the route develop further and further.

The route is one thing but I was also thinking a lot about my path in general. This journey would not just be a vacation. It would be a trip of inner discovery and cultivation. Pushing the hard reset button. I wanted to explore myself and my boundaries. Questions like: How good do I know myself? Wat is my hidden potential? When will I be sad? Can I truly be happy? How big is my ego? When will I miss my family and friends? When will I miss the alcohol and the weed? When will I miss all the comforts of home? Will I like it to be alone all the time? How long can I go out into the mountains with one backpack?...

Years ago a friend introduced me to the term Ikigai. To explain in my words the Ikigai is the point where 3 things come together: What do you love to do? What does the world need? What can you get paid for? This concept stuck with me for a lot of reasons and I think it is a big underlying factor in my motivation to do all this. Being free to do what you love.

Skillwise the main goal is the further development of my martial art- and survival skills. That combined with the development of the more introspective qualities, true inner peace and harmony, the ultimate goal being freedom in body and mind. Almost every story I heard or read about the great Taiji or Zen masters had something in common: they all meditated and they all talk about the essentiality of the quiet and empty mind. To be honest I have found myself to have lot of tensions in my body and mind. 5 years ago I thought I was a pretty chill guy, down to earth, not too big of an ego,… The more attention I gave to the matter, the more I found out that I had the wrong idea about myself. Already a lot has changed but still I’m only scratching the surface of the real internal work.

After watching a lot of YouTube bushcrafters, hikers and survivalists in my free time I decided I would also take a camera with me and try to make some videos about my journey. It seemed like it would be cool for my friends and family, for myself and maybe even some people outside of my network. In essence I see the moviemaking as building my curriculum vitae and I’ll continue to do it as long as I enjoy doing it.

Begin February 2020 I left home together with my dog Sauron. It was super exiting to finally start the journey I had been planning for over 2 years. One side note was very important to me: plans can change. I would not force myself to do any of the things I had in mind before I left. If the training, the hiking, the meditation, the seeking out of the masters,.. didn’t come spontaneously, I wouldn’t do it. If I felt after a few months that I had misjudged all this, I would not let my pride be a factor and just go back home.

**The Stealth Van**

I won’t go too deep into this but everyone that has converted a van will probably know that is a challenging project in its own regard. The research part is a very time-consuming aspect of the vanbuild. In the beginning I thought I would keep it to a bare minimum, I just wanted a place to fall back to when things got hard. As I started researching my wishes started to change and my initial plan to keep the vanbuild to a bare minimum was thrown out of the window rather quickly.

And so I bought a van (Volkswagen crafter L1H1 from 2013), had a design in my head and bought everything that I needed. After all the hours of preparation I finally could start the building part. After a few months, building only in the weekends, my van was finished. I learned so much during the process and awkward enough during the build I was already making plans for the second vanbuild, whenever that will be..

Very important to me was that my van would be as secure and stealthy as possible. My plan was to go on longer trips with my backpack so my van would often be unguarded for longer periods of time, often with a lot valuable stuff in it. This is the reason I haven’t put in any extra windows. I also put a security film on my windows so a quick break-in would be impossible. All my doors are also heavily secured. No way to enter my van quickly if I lock it properly.

\- The first month I really had to acclimate. I hiked a lot with my dog but I didn’t train so much. I did start my daily meditation training in the first week after departure. I slept terrible for a month due to the detox. The nightmares in combination with the meditation made the first month emotional pretty heavy. Nevertheless it was a damn good exercise to feel all the shit from the past boiling up and letting it go.

\- After a few days the thoughts about alcohol and weed were already much less. I was very amazed with that considering I was an addict for 10 years. The detox, the nightmares and sweating at night were a really intense wake up when it comes to acknowledging what kind of shit I had put into my system all those years. You don’t know it until you quit. After 2 weeks the thoughts about smoking and drinking were almost gone. When drinking a coffee it stung to not have a cigarette and even now, when I drink a beer, I instantaneously think about something to smoke. I wonder when that will fade.

\- I am much more synchronized with nature when it comes to my sleeping pattern. I also need less sleep.

\- In week 3 I did my first 2 hour training session, totally unscheduled. On that day I really got into the vibe I wanted to be in. In the next few days I started to train just after a short walk with Sauron and breakfast. It evolved into doing my 2 hour (do what I have to do) session before midday so that anything that I would train in the afternoon and evening was like a bonus. It feels very good to be finished with all your most crucial to do’s early in the day.

\- I started playing the digeridoo and took up my pois again.

\- Almost instantly I became vegetarian. Mostly because I was living on a tight budget and see meat as a luxe product. Since then becoming full time veggie is in my mind almost every time I eat meat.

\- I started eating more healthy than ever before. I started having breakfast again, eating very healthy and zero junk food. I also gained a few kilo’s in weight, which I was happy with since I found myself a bit too skinny.

\- I found out rather quickly that I didn’t need any of the things that made seemingly happy in my daily routine at home. Every craving is also a form of suffering..

\- I often think about the Less is More phrase. It resonates deeply.

\- I enjoy the little things a lot more. Activities like cooking, walking the dog, drinking a cup of tea,… It’s also like everything I eat tastes better.

\- After a good month the seated practice (I can’t really call it meditation yet) started to feel deeper and I noticed that every single time after I meditate I do something useful. Mostly I just rolled into another part of training.

\- The videomaking and especially the making of time lapses keeps bringing me to very nice places and views.

\- I started a daily vlog in English with a double functionality. To keep talking and reflecting out loud and also to practice my English. It feels right to reflect on a daily basis and capture some of it, the medium doesn’t matter. I just prefer speaking to practice my English.

\- Travelling with a dog is great but as everything it has its pros and cons. I can’t imagine doing this without Sauron anymore though.

\- In total I train between 2 and 6 hours almost every day and my training has become much more constant instead of a ‘wave frequency’. Aside from that my days are filled with hiking, cooking and moviemaking and an occasional siesta.

\- **The hard reset button and the change of context is working greatly. I am more disciplined and more fulfilled than ever. Having a plan whilst adhering to the principle of not forcing anything and just going with the flow feels right.**

This will be all for this post, I never imagined it would get so long. For all those who read the whole thing, thank you for bearing with me. I would be happy to hear any of the insights of other travelers/starting meditators or anyone else that can relate to this. Below you can find some of images and videos of my journey. Also, if you want to see some of the travel stories of me and Sauron or you just like some experimental YouTube content with no talking (yet), here is the link to my channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQtW7DBVdjGCYl-xNVvLQlg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQtW7DBVdjGCYl-xNVvLQlg)

Thank you very much, until the next one!

In peace

Floris

travel_ali,ihjd0k,Resources for travel in Switzerland.,"Not a single trip report, but more of a collection of experience and lessons from many trips. I don't think I have posted this here before, it might be useful in this very long planning period. 

Most of my travel here as day or week long trips has been solo travel. This is probably as safe and easy a solo destination as you are going to get. Eating isn't a group thing like in some countries, and other than maybe a few activities that require a booking with a minimal group size you won't find yourself excluded from anything. 

The only real factor for me regarding solo travel here has been that if you really want to meet other travelers then it will be much easier at a hostel in a more popular area than if you go off to other forms of accommodation in the lesser known regions. There are hostels all over the country, but many (especially the YHAs) tend to attract domestic Swiss tourists rather than an international scene. Speaking the local language makes it much easier to get chatting with people, but English often works everywhere (too well given that I still have issues getting people to talk to me in German sometimes).

* I will also try and update or correct posts as I or others spot mistakes, but there could still be errors.

* This is mostly aimed at English speakers, those who speak the local languages will have far more options. 

* I live in the German speaking area so I am very heavily biased to the sights and culture there just through my daily experience.

* I am a little insufferable at always wanting to be different, so I tend to be a bit harsher on popular/famous places than unknown ones. You should try and mentally correct for that.

**Misc tips:**

* Swiss vs European power plug adapters - not always compatible! If you have an EU plug it might not fit into a Swiss socket, but newer ones should do (roughly speaking when the two prongs are 4mm or less in diameter, and 14mm apart they should work in both the EU and Switzerland).

* Cable cars typically stop running at around 5pm (but can be until 10pm or so if it is servicing a village like Mürren). This is especially deceptive in summer when it stays light until much later. Check when the last run is, the internet is full of stories of people who found themselves with a long walk down in the dark. 

---

**Internet - practical**

Many of these also have a phone app version which is worth having.

General:

* [My Switzerland](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-au/home.html). The official and very extensive tourism website. Just about any information you could possibly need about anything is on here.

* [Wikivoyage](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Switzerland). A bit hit and miss: the overview and coverage for places like Zürich is fantastic, but many places are lacking in useful or any info. 

* Local tourist areas all have their own websites. Usually in both summer and winter versions, giving you info on: conditions, what is open,  ideas for what to do, etc:. Eg: [Jungfrau region](https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/), [Zermatt](https://www.zermatt.ch/en), [Appenzell](http://www.appenzell.ch/en/home.html), and so on.

Transport:

* You can get regional travel passes which cover all transport and cable cars in specific areas (Eg: the [Jungfrau region](https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/jungfrau-travel-pass/), or the [Tell pass](http://www.tellpass.ch/en/summer/experience/whats_the_tell-pass/) around Luzern). Likewise there are endless [passes for museums etc in each region](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/gaestekarten.html). 

* [SBB](https://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html). The website (and also app) for the train network covering buses, boats, and cable cars too. Timetables, ticket info, and pass info. It is sometimes better to look up the timetable for seasonal things like cable cars and boats on their own websites (eg: [BLS boats on Brienzersee](https://www.bls.ch/en/fahren/unterwegs-mit/schiff/fahrplan), or [cable cars in the Aletsch region](https://www.aletscharena.ch/cableways/timetable/)) as when they don’t run the SBB just gives a vague “can’t find the connection” notice. They do various [travel passes](https://www.sbb.ch/en/leisure-holidays/travel-in-switzerland/international-guests.html), though it is best to carefully calculate your planned routes or figure out if it is worth it It is worth looking for the off-peak “super saver” tickets which limit you to a certain train but can cut the price in half (and if you have the half-tax this cuts the price again, to as much as 75% off).   


Accommodation

* Official accommodation (which should include Airbnb) will offer a guest card in many tourist areas including free/discounted local transport and activities. Typically this is just in the town/village and places 10-20 minutes away ([eg for Interlaken]( https://www.interlaken.ch/en/info-service/gaestekarten/interlaken-guest-card)), but in the beautiful and underrated canton of Ticino [it covers the entire canton]( https://www.ticino.ch/en/ticket.html). 

* Aside from the standard options for finding rooms you might also want to look into other options such as https://alp.holidaybooking.ch/?language=en, and https://www.rooms.ch/ . Many smaller independent options (especially farms and rural hotels) are not on Booking.com etc and you will have to find them by trawling around on google maps. This could help if you really want to stay in a certain area but everything is booked out, but many of them have a very basic setup so you might need to phone up or fill in a form on their website.

* Another option that might be worth considering is the [Swiss Hotel Card]( https://hotelcard.com/en?change_locale=en), a 99CHF per year subscription that offers half priced hotel rooms. This is limited to participating hotels and doesn’t apply during the high season, but could easily pay for itself with just a single night or weekend. I have yet to try this, but the range of locations looks like it could be quite good for domestic travellers. 

* For more rural hut and farm based accommodation: https://bnb.ch/ , and https://www.bauernhof-ferien.ch/ , and https://www.myfarm.ch/en/accommodation , and https://naturfreunde.ch/haeuser/ . Some like myfarm.ch offer the chance to sleep on straw in a barn.

* Alpine huts are run by a few different organisations. [The SAC website]( https://www.sac-cas.ch/en/) is the best starting point.

* Camping. Standard campsites: www.tcs.ch , www.camping.ch , and www.sccv.ch. In addition there are a few websites where you can officially find a small patch to pitch up on a farm https://www.nomady.ch/ , and [on myfarm.ch too](https://www.myfarm.ch/de/campingplatz-zeltplatz#dontPreselectRegion=true&amp;resultsPerPage=&amp;tagIds=-3360035520941820).

* Wild camping is complex. The best way to sum it up is ""Prohibited but tolerated under conditions"". [This SAC page has the most official guidelines]( https://www.sac-cas.ch/de/umwelt/bergsport-und-umwelt/campieren-und-biwakieren/). There are some pointers for the ideal situation (the more you follow the better): above the treeline, with the community / landowner’s permission, [not in a protected area]( https://map.geo.admin.ch/?lang=de&amp;layers=ch.bafu.wrz-wildruhezonen_portal,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-auen,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-hochmoore,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-flachmoore_regional,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-flachmoore,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-jagdbanngebiete,ch.bafu.schutzgebiete-schweizerischer_nationalpark,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-trockenwiesen_trockenweiden&amp;layers_opacity=0.9,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75&amp;bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&amp;zoom=0&amp;topic=ech&amp;E=2643780.17&amp;N=1164842.39), single tent, set up as the sun goes down and dismantle at dawn, no fire/noise/disturbance/litter. Wild camping has increased in popularity in recent years, [iconic spots like Seealpsee are having problems with numbers]( https://www.fm1today.ch/ostschweiz/appenzellerland/zu-viele-wildcamper-am-seealpsee-135572094), so try and pick a less known spot.

Weather:

* For weather there is [Search.ch](https://meteo.search.ch/grindelwald) which also includes a few webcams and ski info in winter, or [Meteoswiss](http://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/) which has a useful country map.

* There are lots of high-resolution webcams. Check official websites for resorts and cable cars (eg: [Jungfrau region]( https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/live/webcams/)), or [roundshot]( https://www.roundshot.com/xml_1/internet/en/application/d170/f172.cfm) for the best. Useful webcams can also be found at [webcamforinsiders]( https://www.webcam-4insiders.ch/webcam/weissenstein%20bei%20solothurn/1560) and [swisswebcams]( https://www.swisswebcams.ch/).

Maps:

* [Switzerland Mobility](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/summer.html). Detailed map showing all official routes for hiking/biking/skating…. With lots of short and long suggested routes. If you sign up for the (paid) Pro version then you can plan routes on the map with detailed height information and pretty good time estimates. [for example](https://map.schweizmobil.ch/?lang=de&amp;showLogin=true&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;season=summer&amp;resolution=10&amp;E=2746778&amp;N=1236988&amp;trackId=3334166). 

* [map.geo.admin.ch](https://map.geo.admin.ch) (mobile app - Swisstopo). The official govt map is amazing. Quick to load and use on desktop or mobile. You can toggle useful overlays like hiking paths (in some ways better than Mobility above as the levels are shown and the contrast makes it much clearer), and just about anything else from geological features to ski runs, you can even switch to historic versions of the map going back to the mid 1800s and watch the country grow. It will even convert any section you like to PDF for easy saving and printing. All for free.

* When actually out and about I tend to use **Maps.me** on my phone which has rather good coverage of the footpath system and addresses/businesses. That said it does have some big gaps in some areas. I wouldn’t use it for advanced routes, but to check my position and where a certain side path might take me it is mostly very useful. The directions feature sometimes gives good advice and sometimes decides that a perfectly good bit of path can’t be used and that you should take a 3 hour detour. The time calculator does not take height change into account, so do not trust that either.

**Internet - culture**

* [Swissinfo.ch](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng) Swiss news and topics in English.

* [Thelocal.ch](https://www.thelocal.ch/) is more of the same.

* [Newlyswissed](https://www.newlyswissed.com/) is yet more Swiss news with a focus on cultural tips for those adjusting to Switzerland. Though it can be somewhat fluffy click-bait (actually it is mostly pretty crap really).

* Beer. There are apparently more breweries per person in Switzerland than anywhere else in the world. The impressive one man website [Bov.ch](https://www.bov.ch/beer/index-Y.html) maps and is working hard to review them all.

* Music to get you in the mood. Many of the bigger Swiss artists like [Anna Rossinelli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ3T3M22lAA), and [Stefanie Heinzmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WHqq4TmW5k) sing in English (understandable with a slightly bigger potential audience) but there are a surprising number that sing in Swiss-German. In no particular order of name or genre: [Bligg]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixLsLFncL5g) (where else can you see someone rapping and posing on a Zürich skyscraper?), [Kunz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Quf4cT7BR0), [Nemo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hCmUQdDGeE), [Lo und Leduc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APxnaonpOes), [Dabu Fantastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_I8HH2N_qQ), [Züri West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gd4YIFM7ck), [Baschi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghlPjtl7RDY), [Patent Ochsner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzC9oX8O1_M), [Marc Sway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S96gICNe-eE), [De Luca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zoUuLviHHE), [Müslüm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXQlMgiPd8k), [Hedgehog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uCeZx501iU), [Subzonic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cj9iDNWSwQ), [Span](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cGfU4WNoxM), [Mani Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGatIgXERI), [Steff la Cheffe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5YhjiupY08), and [Dodo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6F6KwZa-Es). Having written all that I then just found [this big youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1HrtVjwfFc&amp;list=PLsIqMR6rh5PYeH_HmqkOwzVzl1RBkr5ab). Or if you want to go REALLY Swiss you can go fully native and crash through into the world of [folk-Schlager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReKkGqqYTwU) (at this point you are out-Swissing most of the Swiss who would run up a mountain to avoid that). [This however may be the peak of awful campy self-aware Swissness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwU40AFw9w) (my apologies to every Swiss person who was just reminded about the existence of that). However [this]( https://youtu.be/5zWrb2Oa1cs?t=102) may top that to be the most amazingly bad Swiss thing ever.

* If you speak any of the national languages then the [Swiss broadcasting Corporation]( https://www.srgssr.ch/de/start/) has plenty to offer in each. For example with German there is the SRF is who do a mix of High-German and Swiss-German telly and radio. [SRF Play](https://www.srf.ch/play/tv) is their on demand TV/radio website and app. They are very good at putting their full shows onto youtube - [the main SRF Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SchweizerFernsehen) has quite a bit of content (and there are other [specialised official channels too](https://www.youtube.com/user/SchweizerFernsehen/channels?disable_polymer=1)). Radio podcasts are on [the SRF website](https://www.srf.ch/podcasts) and on Spotify (and probably other places too), for Swiss-German check SRF1 (especially the regionaljournal channels) and SRF3, and for the hardcore the Hörspiel channel often has full plays in Swiss-German.

* [I rather like the SRF archive for the historical videos which can normally be enjoyed without the language.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd0NmHBRRAq5O-ye7kx_VlQ)

-------------------------------


**Books**

* Swiss Watching - Diccon Bewes (2010). Switzerland seen through British eyes. A very readable and enjoyable introduction to the history, people, politics and areas of the country by someone who has lived there for years. Ideal reading as a traveller. There are some over generalisations but given the scope and size it mostly does a good job. If you read anything about Switzerland make it this. [He also has a Google-talk video which is basically a condensed version of the book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7u--e31oOc&amp;) 

* Slow train to Switzerland - Diccon Bewes (2013). The author retraces the first Thomas Cook tour of Switzerland and shows how much has changed since then and by the rise of trains and tourism. A very interesting read for the history and travel ideas. 

* Around Switzerland in 80 Maps - Diccon Bewes (2015).Yet another Diccon book, though this is much more history and culture than travel based. At a large 33x23cm it isn’t travel friendly either, but it is beautifully done with a range of well reproduced images and interesting information. It is accessible and interesting to everyone, but I would say this book is most enjoyable to those who already know the Swiss landscape, history and culture to some extent already. The [TedX talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a480xM9kFyA) that he does on the subject is rather good.

* The [Bergli publisher](https://www.bergli.ch/), which Diccon is part of, have quite a few light hearted books about Swiss culture and Switzerland.

* How the English Made the Alps - Jim Ring (2000). A history of how the development of tourism, climbing, and winter sports played a major role in the development of the Alps. Not just Switzerland, but it is a major focus of the book.

* A Tramp Abroad - Mark Twain (1880). [FREE EBOOK](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/119). Satirical and absurd account of his travels in Europe. The Swiss part is often hilarious. As above is interesting to see just how much the country has changed since then. Several places such as [Weggis-Rigi](https://www.rigi.ch/Vor-Ort/Rigi-Kulm/Wanderwege-ab-Rigi-Kulm/Mark-Twain-Weg) and [Zermatt-Riffelberg](https://www.zermatt.ch/en/Media/Planning-hikes-tours/Mark-Twain-Weg) have Theme walks in the approximate places where he walked himself. A tramp in this sense is to walk, not the homeless person as most people other than the Kiwis might assume.

* Sherlock Holmes - The Final Problem - Arthur Conan Doyle (1893). [FREE EBOOK](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/d/doyle/arthur_conan/d75me/). A quick and easy read of Holmes' ""final"" adventure ending at the Reichenbach falls by Meiringen. He oversells the waterfall somewhat though I must say. 

* The Magic Mountain - Thomas Mann (1924). Inspired by and set in a Davos mountain health retreat. No comment as have yet to read it.

* Heidi - Johanna Spyri (1881). [FREE EBOOK](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20781). The classic kids book which seems to be something of cliché and sales-device these days ([for a start you can visit a fake Heidi house in Heidi village](http://www.heididorf.ch/en/about-us/heidis-village.html)). It is only partly happy alpine adventures, and often rather painfully moralistic. Read until she is put on a train to Frankfurt and that should be enough.

* William Tell - Friedrich Schiller (1804). [FREE EBOOK](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6788). Performed every year in Interlaken amongst other places. Frankly it is really blood boring - the whole thing can be summed up that the Swiss are good christian brothers, and the Austrians are utter wankers.

* Bill Bryson passes through in his 1991 book “Neither here nor there”. While still mostly a good read, being almost 30 years old the info is rather outdated in parts. The country has become much more lively since then for a start.

* La Place de la Concorde Suisse - John McPhee (1984). A very out-dated but in some ways interesting read looking at Swiss military thinking and culture back in the 80s. The attitudes and situation are very different now over 30 years later. This is only really worth it if you really want to learn about that bit of Swiss history. It also commits the cardinal sin of having numerous bits of French scattered about the book but with no translation provided, which is really bloody annoying.

thatwasntcandy,ihqrih,Story time! Dropping phone in river in Japan.,"Last year I went on my first solo trip in Japan, I had the time of my life. I spent 23 days in total. I went to Tokyo (14days), Kyoto (3days), Osaka (3 days), and Nikko (3 days).

Anyway it was my first day in Nikko , I was staying a pretty awesome hostel called Nikko Earth Hostel. It was right on a river, incredible spot really. I was sharing some Sake with some friends I met at the hostel, sitting on the rocks right in front of the river. I had my phone in my pocket, and all the sudden it slides out of my pocket and slides off the rocks into the river. I instinctively jumped in with all my clothes in to try to recover it (it was dark), and I could not find it, being that it would’ve been broken anyway it didn’t matter much.

Keep in mind it’s my first solo trip in a foreign country, let alone one with such a transportation system. My phone was how I navigated the entire trip, so I was freaking out for the first day. Especially because I had to somehow navigate my way all the way from the mountains in Nikko, to my terminal in Narita, with no help. 

It was definitely an experience. Especially because I got a cold after jumping in the river, and I couldn’t hear out of my left ear at all, so I had to try extra hard to hear the train announce the stations and such.

I managed to make it to my terminal, and it was honestly a great and empowering experience that I was able to do this all on my own. It added another element to my trip, not constantly looking at my phone for directions.

I called priceline yesterday for almost 3 hours and they told me I can get a $500 credit for my unused portion of my ticket to reschedule the flight. The problem is, theyrr trying to charge me $1500 to reschedule, so $1000 after my $500 credit. I went to the priceline website to look for the same route and its only $750, so at most they shouldnt be charging me more than $400. So then I thought maybe I just got a bitter rep, and called again, nope, still $1500. So then I called the airline company to see if they could change it, nope... they could change my reservation but couldnt process the actual ticketing. Priceline is trying to cheat me out of more than $500... I even told the priceline rep why would I pay $1000 to reschedule my flight when I can just buy a one way with the exact same route from your priceline website for only $750... and the rep said our website is negotiated prices, we're only authorized to give you retail prices.... so then I went on google flights and even still the price for that route was $930 still lower than the $1500 priceline is trying to charge me. I wouldnt mind the 930, but to charge $1500 which is 100% higher than their own website prices and higher than retail price is just absurd.

- Can be signed up for online from a big selection of countries and posted to you, like a Revolut card

Green-Impossible,iixxmj,Best way to cross border (covertly) between Belarus and Ukraine (to get from Minsk to Kyiv) ?,"Hi, sorry for my lack of Russian (am working on it), but I'm trying to find out if anyone has any info on how one might possibly get across the Ukrainian border (albeit illegally/not through the road), from Minsk to Kyiv.

I arrived in Kyiv today and they denied me entry, changing the rule only yesterday! I have plans to join my girlfriend who lives here in Kyiv, for a month or more. I'm a respectful citizen, and hope to move to Ukraine one day, but I am not keen on letting these formalities shape my love life. Now I am stuck with an option to return home, or otherwise try to cross the border from Belarus, which I would like to, in a bit of a desperate situation.

My idea is to buy a motorbike in Minsk, and ride to the Ukrainian border, break off to a small town, to the woods, and then walk across the border. I'm wondering if anyone here might know of the best/most covert place to do that, between Minsk and Kyiv. Otherwise I will just search for any place on the map that might suit.

One thing is that I cannot cross the river-border, so will have to go around it to the east or west. I don't think it should be too difficult, but does anyone know if there are any things to watch out for, along the forest border? ie. Does Belarus or Ukraine have a giant fence separating them, or anything like that, or guards/cameras or anything along the entire border?

darinett,iiyapk,What sparked your interest to travel?,"I'm sure everyone has a moment where they knew they were meant to travel and explore..These moments are special and definitely keeps us ignited. 

Personally, when I was a child, I used to LOVE riding the airplane, sitting at the window, and gazing at sky. It was magical. I remember the day before every flight I couldn't sleep because of how excited I used to be to reach the airport and explore the *very* expensive shops there, ride on a plane and think to myself what should I eat this time(I LOVE bread and butter), and most importantly just opening the window and getting lost in the view.

Even now, I am 19 F, and trying my best to have a side hustle, save up money, learn languages, and go abroad for couple of years. I used to envy my friends who travel to study abroad! (I still do lol)

relentless_pma,iizta4,First steps in solotavel,"This question might have been asked before, but I want to get this off my chest and this would be the best place. I am a male (30yrs,netherlands, europe) and I really like to travel. For me this came a bit later then for most because I had no travel experience when I was younger with my parents. But later I did a city trip with friends and I enjoyed it very much. Later I did more city trips with them and even 3 longer vacations out of Europe.

So why am I posting in the solotravel subreddit. Well to travel solo has been a thought for a few years now. I wondered how it would be and I think you can really grow as a person. It might sound strange but most of my travels have made me grow in a certain way even if it was with friends. 

But to be honest I am a little scared that I will not like it being alone, not having contact with anyone or something going wrong. I know I am already 30 so it might be crazy that I have these thoughts but it is. I am working hard on improving myself this year on multiple areas and I feel like I should take a first step in solotraveling this year. I am thinking about a 3-5 day trip solo. Somewhere by train or car. 

I was wondering if there are people who feel the same and thinking about doing a solo trip but feeling a bit scared or maybe people who know the feeling but just went out. And tips or recommandations are also welcome ofcourse.

Lone-Oak,ij4osp,Missing Ireland,"I'll get right into it. I haven't really traveled this year, my last travel was a cruise to mexico in Dec 2019 with my GF and my god I regret cruises, nothing against them they just aren't my thing. ANYWAYS, I woke up in one of those depressed moods today and in attempt for a pick me up I decided to pick up my favored drinks from when I studied abroad in Ireland. Guinness and Carlsberg, my two favorite beers while I was there. As I sip away I am reminded of great nights with great friends and freedom. 

I don't know if anyone else feels the same but, there is such a genuine sense of freedom and happiness when I traveled abroad. Thousands of miles from anyone who knows you and you can just be yourself and live such a genuine life. When I studied abroad I went without knowing a single person and the ability to just live is something I have missed every single day since. The ability to not worry about any expectations or any responsibilities except for the ones I chose. 

For me Ireland was what hooked me on solo travel and I miss it so much at this moment, more than I am proud to admit (probably why I am here talking on reddit). I don't know if its just me or if its something inherent with your early 20's where you are just going through some kind of quarter life crisis but idk, does anyone else feel this way?

rakahr11,hy36oy,"Travelling solo for a long time may make one socially ""awkward"". What's your experience with this?","I travel and work at the same time normally, so mostly because of work, i will need time to indulge myself in it and i would become pretty distant from everything. My thoughts need to be centered on the task. I am able to do other things, but being social would distract me too much from my task.

Also, before i got that job, i would sometimes spiral into a state of being alone. I would just focus so much on nature, the cultural sights and fauna, i would simply ""forget"" on doing more but have the occassional necessary exchange of words while buying something like food.

I would find myself not having spoken to anyone for a couple of weeks, sometimes even longer. I would feel the actually need for some kind of social interaction and then it would feel awkward.

Like i have forgotten how to speak to people or i don't get them or they me.

blasianseouls,hy5rld,Should I make the leap?,"Hey guys 26F here. I’ve always had a longing to go to Korea since I was in high school and while I was in college, I had three opportunities to go and chickened out every time because my friends backed out last minute. It really made me depressed that I was always waiting on friends to make MY dream come true. 

Last year I had another opportunity to go with friends and I finally was able to go but it was only for a few days. Those five days were the best five days of my life hands down. While I was over there, I always walked around alone and explored different places because I just wanted to take everything in. (The friends I was traveling with weren’t as eager to be there as I was) I was so happy and on cloud 9 that I don’t remember if I was in or could have been in any danger. This brings me to my predicament at hand.

Since my job has become a WFH situation, I have so much time on my hands. I spoke to my boss about possibly traveling overseas somewhere and they told me they don’t mind what my background looks like on team calls, as long as my work is getting done. He also encouraged me to go as I’m getting more and more anxious from the problems going on in America right now and how we are handling everything so poorly. (I’m black and with the civil unrest so prevalent right now I fear being alone in public but that’s a whole different thread) 

I personally want to travel to Korea for some R&amp;R but I’ve come to realize I’m terrified of going by myself and I keep thinking of what if’s. I remember korea being safe for foreigners as I never felt unsafe (but I was also too happy to even notice anything at all). My boyfriend is encouraging me to go alone because he said the best way to find yourself is a solo trip somewhere.

With the way korea has handled the COVID-19 situation, I personally would feel safer there than here in the US. The current travel situation is pretty strict with incoming foreigners; you have to quarantine at a government facility for two weeks and you have to pay anything from $1200-$2100 for the two weeks. They are now mostly hotels since the virus and incoming foreigners have dropped significantly. Tickets there are very cheap, the Airbnb for three weeks costs less than $800 and with the only expensive piece being quarantine, I think it’s a steal. 

Anyway, I wanted to ask if any of you guys have been to Korea recently? Should I take the leap of faith and go? I feel like once things go back to normal, I won’t have the same opportunity again which makes me fear that I’m going to miss out on my dream again. I don’t want to rush anything nor do I want to risk anything else. (It also doesn’t help that COVID-19 is a thing) I just need a way of getting over the fear of traveling alone. I’ve seen way to many unsolved mysteries and true crime stories lol

How did you all overcome the solo trip fear? Any advice on how to take the jump? Has anyone taken a solo trip to Korea recently? If so, how was it?",solotravel,1595764867

I'm planning on visiting the U.S. properly (Disney World doesn't count imo!) for the first time next year and have always wanted to go to the Pacific Northwest. I've mapped out a 2 week itinerary (just how long in each place atm; I will decide what activities to do later on but have a rough idea currently). I am wondering if you think this is a good plan, or am I affording too much/not enough time to certain places?

1. Fly to Vancouver, BC. Travel day. Get into VBC in the evening ideally.

2. Get Amtrak to Eugene, OR (a long journey, so this is basically a travel day and the evening/afternoon in Eugene)

3. Eugene, OR

4. Salem, OR (travel via Amtrak in the morning; short journey)

5. Portland, OR (travel via Amtrak in the morning; short journey)

6. Portland, OR

7. Olympia, WA (travel via Amtrak in the morning; short-ish journey)

8. Seattle, WA (travel via Amtrak in the morning; short journey)

9. Seattle, WA

10. Seattle, WA

11. Seattle, WA

12. Vancouver, BC (travel via Amtrak in the morning; short journey)

13. Vancouver, BC

14. Fly to London (get a night flight to enable an extra day in Vancouver).

FYI I have included lesser-known (at least in the UK) places such as Eugene, Salem and Olympia as I have always wanted to visit a U.S. college town as well as some state capitols, so I thought I could soak up the ambience in Eugene and also go on some tours of the capitols in Salem and Olympia.

My two other friends and I are supposed to book the tickets sometime next month, but they’re heads are not nearly in it as much as mine so probably 70/30 in favour of solo travelling. 

This will be my first solo travel experience, I have lots of family in Hungary so I plan to start and end the trip there. (obviously). After Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, Czech, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia. Maybe I will squeeze Germany, Switzerland, Italy(Milan), and potentially Ukraine.  Hungary Is somewhat right in the middle of all these countries, I can do the rotation of countries counter clockwise, and end in Bosnia then back to Hungary. 

I have all the money saved right now, planning on taking $8000 CAD, which I think is more than enough, I plan on embodying the frugal backpacker mentality, I know I’ll probably be unlikely to rent a vehicle, considering I’m not 21, or don’t know how to drive stick. 

For all you young solo travellers how did you get your parents to approve of your trip, I know I’m an adult, but my parents still have a very protective mentality, even though both my parents left home at the age of 21/22 to a whole new continent with nothing but a suitcase full of clothes. I plan to just book the trip then maybe just spill the beans 1 week/month earlier? 

The Motive: So the majority of the people I went to school with are all in university right now, and my immediate friend group basically just working “dead end” jobs with a lazy just sit around and smoke weed mentality, I want to get out there and experience the world, I know realistically solo travel will more often than not be as glamorous as the movies.

billyhicks88,hyq7a6,Trip report - 11 countries in Europe (July 2020),"After being stuck at home for months and with a major Central Asia/Middle East adventure long cancelled, I thought I'd see how much of Europe I could \*safely\* explore with lockdowns being eased and borders being opened. I'm 31/M, live in the United Kingdom and travelled solo with my Irish passport, acquired at the end of last year to give me more travel freedom post-Brexit. My route essentially took me from Estonia to Italy, but it ended up being something of a zig-zag back and forth due to limited flights/train connections and uncertainty over borders being open or not - my goal was to get to see 11 countries which would be a new monthly record for me, so here's how it went.

At the beginning of July I boarded my first flight in four months, a domestic one from London Heathrow to Belfast City. Masks were compulsory on all flights throughout my travels and none were completely full, so if you were stuck in between two people you could easily move to an empty row with no problems.  After a few (very wet) days there I got the bus down to Dublin, and arrived in the week that hotels and hostels reopened again so I could stay in very quiet accommodation (I had a shared dorm all to myself), get a well-needed haircut and enjoy sitting inside a coffee place again for the first time in forever. From there I entered mainland Europe flying to Vienna - there was an extra line of officers before Austrian passport control to check passports, where you've been in the last few days and how long you're staying. Travellers from the United Kingdom weren't allowed to enter without quarantine at the time (they are now), but as I'd been in Ireland for several days and had my boarding pass for my next country, I was happily let in.

The weather in Vienna was \*stunning\*, and some attractions had heavily discounted prices as they'd just reopened again that week - the Belvedere was €4 instead of €16. I hiked around the Wachau Valley and took day trips to Cesky Krumlov/Ceske Budejovice in the Czech Republic, and Sopron in Hungary, all easily done as the Schengen borders were open with no restrictions. Masks were required on all public transport (which everyone followed) but at the time they weren't needed in shops - they've since changed the rules in Austria so that they are.

Sleeping in Vienna Airport on the final night (my next flight was at 6am, I was happily let in airside so I could find a quiet sofa to myself rather than be stuck in Arrivals) I headed on to Tallinn, Estonia on Wizz Air. This route in theory has no passport control but like Austria they'd temporarily added a line of officers to check your passports at Tallinn Airport when you arrived. In this part of the world the virus is almost gone - cases are mostly at zero, masks and social distancing are still recommended but few need to wear them anymore and nightlife had resumed. Hand sanitiser was still regularly around which I was still using just in case! I met some amazing people in my hostel, all of us excited about being the first ""post-lockdown tourists"" and we enjoyed some really good nights out in Tallinn, clubs/bars were open here but restricting the amount of people who could be inside at one time.

Via Tartu and Valga/Valka I went overland through Latvia, seeing a bit of Riga and then onto the west coast of Lithuania, where I was thankful for very good weather around Klaipeda as I enjoyed the beach in Palanga and the Curonian Spit - the sand dunes at Nida early in the morning were blissfully quiet and an amazing sight, and into the middle of the country I had the Hill of Crosses all to myself for a good few minutes. Then, taking advantage of a special €9.99 Wizz Air deal, I headed from Vilnius down to Milan, Italy.

I was a bit concerned about being in Lombardy, both because of it being the major European epicentre of the outbreak a few months earlier, and rules stating that face masks must be worn at \*all times\* - even outdoors, and it was 32 degree heat! But just three days before I arrived the rules were relaxed, no masks needed outdoors anymore but still indoors on transport and in public places. It was the first time I'd been there since a family holiday 12 years ago, and again met some amazing new friends at the hostel (very recently reopened) who provided great company and who I hope to visit in the world when it's possible. I took a day trip to (beautiful) Lugano in Switzerland, and stunning Lake Como, the view from the Volta Lighthouse really is one I'll never forget.

I'd previously intended to fly home from here, but instead changed my flight so I flew from Milan to Krakow in Poland, where we were given locator forms on the flight we had to fill out which were collected later on. I headed down to Zakopane and explored the Tatra Mountains on the Polish/Slovakian border, seeing a bit of the Slovakian side while I was there too. Despite arriving at 7am on a Thursday, it was still surprisingly busy! Hiked for about two hours to Lake Morskie which was an amazing sight, returning to Krakow in the evening and exploring the city centre there too.

Then it was finally back to London! I filled out the online locator form as it was stated we had to show it to border guards when we returned, but in fact nothing of the sort happened - we just arrived at Stansted, through the e-gates with no checks at all. As all the countries I'd been in for 14 days were on the safe list, I didn't need to quarantine on arrival. Despite lots of nerves beforehand, it ended up as one of my all-time favourite travel adventures and I'm happy to have stayed safe, seen some wonderful places and met great new friends. Hoping on travelling more of the world whenever it becomes possible!",solotravel,1595847701
travel_timer,hyt5h1,What's the longest you've ever travelled continuously?,"I'm currently working full-time and I love my job, but I know that my ultimate dream is travel. I'm working as a nurse and honestly working during COVID has really solidified my desire to travel, and live abroad. I just want to see and experience as much of the world as I possibly can. 

I made a previous post about how much I think about travel. The more I think, the more places I want to visit and my post COVID trip route grows longer and longer. My current plan is travel from Southeast Asia, up through the Middle East, then to Europe, through the Balkans, and ending in France and Spain. I'm figuring this will take about 20 months to do. And I'm so excited. But other times, that seems like a looong time to be away. So I'm wondering what other people's experiences of longer long-term travel have been.

Draakondo,hytww6,Future solo trip to Iceland,"Hey guys!! A little backstory to this post: I had to do research on Iceland in school a while ago and I honestly fell in love with the country from afar. Since then I’ve wanted to travel there, to get to know the people and really experience the culture for what it is. When I travel, I don’t like to be the stereotypical tourist - I like to immerse myself in the culture and just... live it. 

That being said - I’m going to be going (back) to college this year, and during the summer I’ll have 4 weeks to do whatever I want. I would LOVE to make a trip to Iceland at some point within the four years I’ll be at school. This trip wouldn’t be until summer of 2022 at the EARLIEST - but I want to start getting an idea of it now so I can save up enough money for it. I may or may not bring a friend, but as of right now I’d be solo. 

The things I’m curious about: 
- safety (I’m a 20 year old female now, will be at least 22 when I travel). I’m physically very fit and lift weights regularly but I want to know the best safety strategies for someone like me traveling alone. 

- how do I find places to stay that aren’t just stereotypical hotels? Like I said, I want to really experience life there. Is there some kind of program/organization not through a school that I’d be able to do? I grew up on a farm and it would be awesome to see the differences between farm life in the US and farm life there.  (I don’t need legitimate schooling, my degree is already advanced and I will want a break, lol) 

- what types of things can I do? I do know I want to go to SOME of the typical tourist attractions - like Hallgrímskirkja, and the Blue Lagoon. I would love to drive the ring road (I think it’s called??) but I don’t know too much about that. 

- anything else that’s relevant, really. Please don’t make warnings about covid since this trip will be in two to three years and I do not need to think about travel cautions for that right now. I’m just trying to estimate expenses to try and save as much as I can. I don’t really have a budget as of yet, since I’m still figuring out logistics and don’t know how much I’ll be able to save/spend, if that makes sense.

I see some advantage in this like for example you can see the places in person and if you really like a place you can stay longer or leave earlier if you don't.

However I also see some problems. Now in covid time its easier to find a place but in normal situations in certain places it might be hard to find a place or it may be more expensive if you don't book in advance. So if you want to keep a low budget maybe a planned trip is better.

iminhy,hz7ozp,"[Trip Report] Solo Travel Japan August 2019 (With Highlight VIDEO) - Tokyo, Mt. Fuji, Hakone, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Nara, Osaka","# Partly making this post now because I finally finished editing all of my video clips. Check out this final video [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r0WflcKteU)

**Intro:** I was an American 25M that quit my job to start graduate school in Fall 2019, but took a two-week solo trip in between to Japan in August. I visited Tokyo, Mt. Fuji, Hakone, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Osaka, and Nara. Note that one of the goals of my trip was to film different aspects of Japan for a video montage, so this trip report might be geared towards that. Total trip cost : \~$3000 USD (including flight).

**Days 1-5 (TOKYO):** Flew in via Japan Airlines (10/10) and checked-in my luggage with Wise-Owl hostel (10/10). My favorite ramen place was Ramen Hayashida in Shinjuku. Tsukiji fish market was also really nice for small but very diverse eats. Favorite temple was the Sensoji Temple, but go at night since it's less crowded and pictures look so much better! Do note that the lights turn off after a certain time (I think 10-11pm) so don't go too late. Another must is the teamLab PLANETS TOKYO museum. I'd choose it over teamLab Borderless if you don't have time for both. Least favorite place was the Tokyo Imperial Palace since it was under construction. For aerial views of Shibuya crossing, you can get a decent view from the top of Magnet by Shibuya 109 (Mag's Park) for 300 yen. Ginza crossing is also a nice aerial view and is less populated. I was able to get to the top of the building across from the Fujiya building for free, and it was not crowded at all.

**Days 5-6 (Mt. Fuji**): August is the HOTTEST time of the year, so be forewarned. But the upside is that Mt. Fuji is open for climbing. Note that Mt. Fuji does not have it's snowy tip since it's all melted, this is something I did not anticipate for photos. Anyhow, I'm not an avid climber but am decently fit and found it somewhat challenging. Do your research on proper hiking and gear beforehand; Don't hike it unprepared (shoes and poles). I took a bus from Tokyo to Mt. Fuji 5th Station and climbed the Yoshida trail for up to the 7th station where I rested for a few hours at the Tomoekan (7th station) Hut which I reserved a month in advance. In hindsight, an 8th station hut might have been a better pit stop. I woke up at 11:30pm and continued the hike until I reached the top at sunrise, where the temperature dropped to about 33°C. Best view of my life (see video). The hike up was 7 hours total and hike down was 4 hours. The hike down was brutal since the trail was filled with ash and the sun was blazing. Still worth it though.

**Days 6-7 (Hakone):** Took a bus to Hakone, which is known for its onsens. I didn't explore the onsens much but wish I had since it would have been really nice after a long hike. I stayed at Emblem Hotel flow, which was okay and they had their own onsen which I thought was lackluster. I mainly went to Hakone to see Lake Ashi and the Hakone Shrine. Go early if you want to avoid the line for pictures!. Otherwise the lake itself is a great view and you can rent a paddle boat. At night, there was a firework festival over the lake which I unfortunately missed.

**Days 7-11 (Kyoto):** Took the Shinkansen from Odawara to Kyoto and stayed at Piece Hostel Sanjo, which was right next to the Niski Market which I loved. Kyoto is much quieter and very ""Japan"" as it's known for its shrines and temples. Fusimi Inari, Kinkaku-ji , Hokan-ji to name a few. Arashiyama was also nice for the bamboo forest (which I thought was a bit over-hyped since it was smaller than I thought) and the monkey park. If you're up for a thrill, I met up with another redditor and hiked Fushimi Inari at night time. Much different experience since it was less crowded but also a whole different (scary) vibe. One place I wanted to go was Hirobun and the nearby Kifune shrine, which was a bit farther north. One thing I'd also recommend trying is to rent a bike to get around! My favorite food spots were Okinomiyaki Katsu (a small but nice neighborhood mom &amp; pop spot) and Menbaka Fire Ramen which puts on a nice fire show for you.

**Days 11-13 (Osaka):** I realized during my trip that it was August 6, the anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing. There was Toro Nagashi (lantern festival) happening, so I spontaneously booked a Shinkansen ($$$) to Hiroshima and spent the night there at the lantern festival. Met up with a few redditors from [r/japantravel](https://www.reddit.com/r/japantravel/) for a couple of drinks afterwards :).

**Day 11 (Nara):** A day trip to Nara is easily doable as it is only \~1hr away from Osaka or Kyoto. There are deers everywhere in throughout Nara park. They wander aimlessly throughout the park/city. Todai-ji is also a great temple to visit in the area too. If you get the chance, check out the famous two men pounding mochi at Nakatanidou.

**Days 11-13 (Osaka):** I'd say Osaka stood out to me at the place for nightlife. I went on an Osaka Pub Crawl which was super fun. Just a bunch of other travelers getting together for a fun night out in Osaka for a few yen. Dontonburi is really nice during the night, so check that out. Osaka castle was as expected. The aquarium is cool too for some video shots but it was VERY crowded. Kuromon market was my favorite fish market in the entire trip!

**Day 14 (Tokyo):** Not sure why I didn't fly out of Osaka instead of Tokyo but hindsight is 20/20. Spent this day to wind down and pack some souvenirs. Also took this chance to stay in one of those capsule hotels. I chose Nine Hours in Tokyo, which was a very interesting experience. The capsules are actually a lot roomier than I had thought.

**Final Thoughts:** Suica/Pasmo card is a must. A debit card without transaction fees (I used Capital One 360) is also very helpful to withdraw yen on the spot. Every convenient store had an ATM, so this was easy. I had $5000 in the account and that was more than enough. A coin purse is also very helpful since cash is king and you'll be getting A LOT of coins back. I took extra precautions with a travelling belt to hold my valuables (i.e. passport), but overall my impression of Japan was that it was very safe and the people there were always very willing to help tourists. August is also one of the hottest times to travel (37C/98F on most days) so I had to take breaks during the day in the hostels or convenient stores. However another upside of this season is that there were many firework festivals (I went to about three in each city). I didn't need to know any Japanese other than ""Thank you."" If you plan to climb Mt. Fuji, plan ahead of time and do your research. Also, if you are a solo traveler, don't hesitate to meet people you meet in the city, hostels, or even on reddit! They were a large part of the experience for me! Remember to check out my [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r0WflcKteU) as it gave me a lot of nostalgia editing it!",solotravel,1595909041

The famous Dutch Oliebol, which translates into: 'OilBall' is a delicious snack that you can only get when you visit during the winter. The preparation of an Oliebol is actually very simple but the taste is really good. An Oliebol is practically just donut dough made into a ball and then fried until the outside is brown. But this is not where it normally stops. Many people decide to put a little bit of Poedersuiker (Powdered sugar) over it and that really finishes it off, or if you want to go for the real traditional Oliebol you have to put raisins in the dough before frying. This snack is for the people that really enjoy a warm ""snack"" during the winter.

Dutch people really like their fast-food, but Dutch Fastfood looks slightly different from the American variant. Although you can also get Burgers and chicken nuggets. The real Dutch snack is a nice Bamischijf or in this case Kroket. A Kroket is basically a meat ragout with a fried coating. There isn't much else to add to that, other than saying that a nice Kroket on some bread is a perfect meal when going out.

Hagelslag is another typical Dutch thing that you won't see fast in other places in the world. Hagelsslag isn't necessarily something you'd eat by itself. More so as a ""topping"" on your bread. We Dutch people really like bread. and more so with some good toppings like Peanut butter chocolate paste or Hagelslag. Chocolate sprinkles made to put on your bread, perfect, and ""healthy"" breakfast.

Dutch people are really good at managing water. And with that, we learned that we could eat a lot of things that came out of that water. Our favorite: the Haring. A slippery eel-like fish with some sour after-taste. And although this might sound like some weird Swedish delicacy (which it partly is) We [Dutch people sure like a nice Haring](https://www.google.com/search?q=Haring+eten&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi4nu_upPDqAhWHtKQKHb8uA2IQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=Haring+eten&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBggAEAUQHjIGCAAQBRAeMgYIABAIEB4yBAgAEBg6BAgAEENQ8FVYs1pggFxoAHAAeACAATeIAfkBkgEBNZgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nwAEB&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=r0cgX_iKN4fpkgW_3YyQBg&amp;bih=937&amp;biw=1920#imgrc=-gelWeGkPreBTM) after a long day at the beach or another sea-related activity.

Pannekoeken (Pancakes) Isn't something very original or Dutch, but I thought I'd mention it anyway because the way we eat our Pancakes might be very different from the way you do it. We do not like thick pancakes stacked on top of each other with some syrup and butter, no. The only real and Dutch way to bake Pancakes is by grabbing your biggest pan, baking the pancake thin as paper, and stacking 20 on top of each other so the whole family can grab one. Our toppings do not differ much but a pancake with cheese or bacon is also really good!

[**Stamppot**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Stamppot&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYnJeApfDqAhVZgqQKHZEBCXQQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=Stamppot&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIFCAAQsQMyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BAgAEEM6BwgAELEDEENQxWRYunFgnXJoAHAAeACAAT2IAacDkgEBOJgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nwAEB&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=1EcgX9jiDNmEkgWRg6SgBw&amp;bih=937&amp;biw=1920#imgrc=cU6zFh-luHJkjM)  
Just like the Oliebol is this something you won't see much unless you visit during the winter. When everyone is crawled up in their homes and is enjoying the warmth and coziness of their thermostat while it's snowing outside. During these times Dutch people resort to some of our favorite dishes: Zuurkol, Boerenkool, hotspot, and many more. Which all can be names Stamppot, a collective name. Stamppot is usually a big casserole type of dish made with not more than four or five ingredients, but every Stamppot must have potatoes and a Kankworst (Big sausage).

Last not but least Een bakje met nootjes (A bowl with nuts). Every Dutch bar or restaurant has one at its bar. A dirty glass bowl filled to the brim with peanuts or borrelnootjes (Peanuts in a crusty coat), It's not usually something you'd order but you grab a couple when you leave the bar after you ordered some drinks. The dirty side about this is that you're of course not the only one that grabbed a couple of nootjes when you went to grab a drink, and the people that run the place aren't switching the bowl out just because you grabbed a few. So when you do go to a Dutch bar make sure you NEVER go for the last borrelnootjes or peanuts at the bottom of the bowl, unless you want three types of diseases.  


Well, this was a list filled with some of my favorite and some weird food we eat here in the Netherlands and that you should definitely try out when you come here.  
I hope you enjoyed the list, and keep in mind to never go for the last borrelnootjes.

 and I will probably go alone. The thing is that everyone keeps saying that it's a dangerous place for women. 

I'm Moroccan but I've lives my whole life in Europe. And I've traveled alone to Marrakech. The things I did for security in Marrakech were: dressing like women there, making sure I'm on the hotel before sunset and avoiding areas with no tourists. And if I did go out at night but with a group of other tourists I meet. I feel like doing this I was safe. And also I wouldn't go with my camera out, I would take pictures and stuff but while I wasn't using it I would put it back in my backpack. 

I've read in a survey a few years ago that out of all touristic countries Morocco is the second one most dangerous for women. And Egypt is number one. And I've traveled to Morocco with no problem. So I should be alright going to Egypt? I didn't know. 

If someone has been to Morocco and Egypt it would be nice if you could tell me if it's any different. And also I know that if you're European or Asian you probably had a different experience.

Over the following two weeks Pat and I spent our nights chatting away over seemingly endless pints of Guinness. In his younger days he was a Premier League football coach and he shared countless tales with me. He gave me sage advice which led me through a transitional period in my young life. He taught me how to drink Guinness (in three gulps, but you order your next pint after the second gulp).

We grew close during our time together, so much so that on my last night in Ireland he and the other friends I had made at the pub wouldn’t let me leave. We stayed until close and even a bit after. I ran out of (cash) Euro’s, but my new friends insisted that I stay so they paid for my pints. They made me promise that I would come back to the pub to see them, and of course I obliged.

Fast forward three and a half years, and my family in Ireland was hosting a large family gathering for St Patrick’s Day 2017. I was elated upon hearing the news. Not only would I be going to Ireland with my brother Jon, but I could also reunite with Patrick and introduce my brother to all my friends in County Kildare.

Our first night at the cottages I took Jon down to the local pub, and all around me were familiar faces. I smiled and nodded at everyone while looking around for Pat. His seat at the bar was empty and he wasn’t out back with the smokers. After searching the pub, I found a young woman who I had met on my last stay. I asked if she knew Pat, and the color instantly drained from her beautiful face. She glanced up at a photo hanging above the bar. Instantly I knew what this meant. I was too late. I had waited too long. My promise to return was unfulfilled.

Few moments in my life compare to what I had felt that night. I lost focus on everything around me and slowly backed up to exit the pub. I didn’t want to be caught crying in front of friends and family alike. Jon had followed me out and helped get me back to the cottage. That night I wept myself to sleep, and when I awoke it felt like a piece of my soul was missing. My brother poked his head in to let me know he was heading down to the café with some of our family for breakfast. I told him I’d meet up in a bit, even though I felt like doing nothing.

Eventually I put myself together and walked into town. I entered the café and a large table was occupied by my brother and some extended family. Everyone looked up me. Before I could say anything, Jon stood up, grabbed my arm, and said “u/FrenchBowler..”. The tone of his voice was serious, but with a slight quiver to it. I could tell something was up.

“… I was walking along the canal this morning thinking about last night, and I saw a piece of trash on the ground. I don’t know why, but I decided to pick it up. Is…is this Pat?”

I took the laminated piece of paper from him. It was heavily tattered and worn, but sure enough the man in the picture was my old friend Pat. It was his memorial card from his funeral- dated January 2nd, 2016. *18 months prior* to this moment.

“I have to admit, when I saw this… I was shook.”

Shook was certainly one word for it. I however felt an overwhelming sense of fulfillment and joy. As my eyes swelled up I knew everything was okay, and so did Pat.

TL;DR I met an older gentleman named Pat on one of my first solo travel experiences. 3.5 years later I went back to see him, but he had since passed. The next morning my brother found his memorial card laying on the ground along the canal near where Pat and I had met. It was Pat’s way of letting me know that he knew I had come back to see him like I promised.",solotravel,1593185521
vicky10129,hgapku,Solo female travel: dress code opinion for the middle east/africa,"A little context: I will be travelling to the Middle East/Africa in a few months and have been doing lots of research on solo female travelling and the customs. I will be going to Egypt, Jordan and Isreal with a possible extension to Turkey (haven't decided if im going to europe yet). I've seen a lot of posts about how to dress however many of them are dated and well, to be blunt, the women posting about it are generally white, or at least very western looking. I am not white. i'm not of arab decent either but for some reason i get mistaken as one a lot ( specifically morrocan or egyptian). I don't see it but whenever I travel or even in my every day life I get spoken to in arabic or asked if i am egyptian/morrocan but its only people of those backgrounds asking. Also i tend to wear headscarves ( im not religious i just like to cover my hair). And because of that I am wondering how i should dress. I have two options: 
A: I dress like a tourist. Im not one to wear revealing clothing so i'd be bringing pants and long skirts with tshirts/long sleeves and probably some sneakers. And I would purposely add a keychain of a canadian flag to my bag to stick out as a tourist because i read theyre more lenient with tourists. 
or
B: I dress more in a middle eastern style to ""blend in"". And by doing so i would assume i wouldnt get any unwanted attention as they wouldnt think i'm a tourist.

Daz00,hge66b,How to Enjoy Dublin (Updated),"I wrote a piece on here a while back in defence of my home city, which seems to get a bad rep on on here as being “souless” or “just another city” so I’ve decided to update it with better and new information, and better structure. Hope you enjoy, and hopefully we can all get back to travelling soon!

The average trip to Dublin seems to go as follows: Book of Kells, Guinness storehouse, Temple Bar. A package of disappointment usually rolled into 1.5 days before moving onto Galway or London.


Dublin is amazing because of its people, snugs and pubs, it’s tradition of literature, it’s booming underground music scene, coziness, beautiful parks and thriving vintage fashion. It’s a place that can be seen in two days, but not experienced. We lack the jaw dropping ornate colonial architecture or towering monuments of many other European cities, but we make up for it in stories, in character, and in the people of Dublin themselves. 

The first most important step to enjoying Dublin is freeing yourself from expectations. This is a city, it’s not going to be like the romanticised Irish countryside. It is relatively small, so it lacks the same bustle and amenities of Berlin or London. Life is slower and simpler than much of the rest of Europe, while contrasting with a cosmopolitan vibe. 


*Enjoy the real pubs of Dublin*

*quick note. Sitting at the bar, you will be engaged in conversation by strangers. Sitting in a booth or table is a sign to others you want to be left alone. 

Most tourists end up going to Temple Bar, spending €8 on a pint and finding that “historic pub” was founded 20 years ago, only visited by tourists and you’re now broke. Temple Bar should be avoided for its pubs, though it does offer other reasons to visit. Having one pint at a famous pub is a great way to meet other travellers, just after gathering a group head out and explore Dublin’s great, and more affordable pubs!

* John Kavanagh’s/Gravediggers Pub. Located beside the historic Glasnevin cemetery, and near the Botanic Gardens, this local haunt is famous among Dubliners but usually without many tourists. Has a beautiful historic Interior.
* The Cobblestone in Smithfield, a short walk from the traditional Dublin area of Stonneybatter, this pub has free Irish music almost every night which is aimed toward a local crowd. 
* Lannigans on Eden Quay is decked out in Halloween decor all year which has been collected over the decades, pints €5.50. There are two pubs, the one on the right is better and has a more impressive interior.
* Thomas House. This Thomas St pub is located in the working class Liberties district of Dublin, near Christchurch. It is the home of Dublin’s Punk, Ska, and general alternative scene of Dublin. 
* Fibber McGees is a Rock and metal bar popular with Dublin’s alternative crowd. Lovingly known as Fibbers by Dubliners.
* Mary’s Bar and Hardware/Wowburger: Iconic Dublin retro diner restraunt hidden in the basement of a Pub that also functions as a hardware shop. What’s not to love?
* O’donoghues and neighbouring Nesbitts on Merrion Row have beautiful snugs and interiors, great hidden gems. Snugs are partitioned wooden rooms in a pub, originally for women to drink in privacy they survive because of the cozy privacy they offer for everybody. 
* G.P Grogans between George’s st Arcade and Castle Market is where all the artsy 30-50 year olds hang out. Great pub, frequented by great people.
* The Long Hall, a Victorian heritage pub.
* The Bernard Shaw in Phibsborough, and its food/beer garden. Draws a young crowd. 
* Honourable mentions: The Flowing Tide, John Fallon’s, The International Bar, The Wild Duck, The Boar’s Head, Kehoes. Walk 10 minutes in any direction away from Temple Bar, you will find a good pub.

*What attractions are Worth it?*

It seems a lot of Dublin’s most popular attractions are pretty mediocre, or not worth the wait or price. Luckily Dublin has an abundance of great things to do. Most of which are free, which is why they’re not advertised by tour companies or the tourist board.

* Kilmainham Gaol is not free, but it is a must do. Tickets must be bought in advance. While in the area visit the War memorial gardens, the Museum of Modern Art, The Phoenix park which has a native deer population.
* Capelizod Village is also nearby, it has a quaint village feel, just five minutes from the city. Nearby is the scenic strawberry beds, which feels like stepping back into the 1880s with Iris large derelict factories, greenery and quaint houses. 
* The Jameson and Guinness Distillery are both supposed to be good.
* The RHA (Royal Hibernian Academy) is a free Modern Art museum, located on a beautiful Georgian street juxtaposed between Merrion square and Stephens Green. 
* The Dead Zoo is a museum on Merrion Square with a massive collection of dead insects, birds, mammals etc, in its original cluttered Victorian Layout. Totally free, a rare example of an original Victorian museum layout. 
* The National Gallery at Merrion Square. Nearby The Museum of Archeology on Kildare st is a Palladian Architectural marvel, and the first place Dublin’s different social classes could intermix freely. Contains beautiful Celtic golden jewellery, bodies preserved in bogs, Viking artefacts, and Egyptian and Cypriot relics. 
* George’s st arcade, Europe’s oldest shopping centre. 
* Medieval Dublin. At Audeon’s church explore a less visited medieval church for free, where you can see the unearthed remains of Dublin’s old streets. Behind it you can find the still functional medieval city gate, unknown even to many Dubliners. On the Northside explore the crypts of St Michan’s church, where you can touch a mummified crusader for good luck.  There are various old churches up and along Thomas street, some of which are now breweries. 
* Cheater Beatty Library and Dubhlinn Gardens: This free to enter museum  of Islamic and East Asian Art was donated to the people of Ireland by a American Billionaire. Located in the beautiful Dubh Linn (Blackpool) Gardens behind the castle from where the city gets its name. 
* The Parks and Canals of Dublin. The Phoenix Park is Europe’s largest walled park. Home to a native Deer Herd, the city zoo, Victorian tea houses and miles of meadow and forest, rent a bike and explore it for a few hours. Merrion Square is a grand Georgian park square, home to the Oscar Wild monument, it’s a more tranquil Stephens green.  St Stephens Green is the Heart of Dublin, and around the corner the Iveagh Gardens are one of Dublin’s best secrets. With a rose garden, maze, two large fountains, ruined statues, a beautiful waterfall. The Iveagh Gardens are Dublin’s most romantic and peaceful park. Just south is the Grand Canal, separating the city centre from its dense posh Victorian Suburbs of Rathmines, Ranelagh and Ballsbridge. It’s peaceful, green and dotted with canal boats. Walk it’s length from Dublin’s modern dock lands to Portobello or vice versa.
* Botanic Gardens/Glasnevin Cemetary. Located right beside one another, you could spend the best part of a day between them. I reccomend a guides tour of Glasnevin cemetary, one of Irelan’s most historic places. The botanic Gardens are a stunning example of Victorian greenhouses, with a lillypod lined river seemingly ripped out of a French impressionist painting. 
* Higgins Figgis, Dublin’s oldest bookshop. The winding stairs bookshop. Ha penny Bridge and Merchants Arch medieval gateway.




General nightlife

•The Workman’s Club is arguably a club, a pub and a place to catch a good gig. It’s the perfect package really. If you like hip-hop, 90s music, punk, indie, rock they have seperate floors with seperate themes. You can usually catch a local or international act here for €10-€15. The smoking level also has a Dublin-famous WOWBURGER which is not to be missed!




*Visit the Markets*

Shop for food cheap on Moore st, but sadly those markets are a shell of their former self. Head up through the liberties up Thomas st especially on a Saturday afternoon and you’ll pass countless stands selling everything from bananas, chocolate, tissue roll to weed grinders for affordable prices. Then head up Meath street to the Liberty Markets building (thurs-sat) and grab a vegetarian pizza from Lucky’s! Howth Market is nice too, if pricy. 

*Visit antique shops*

Plenty dotted around, especially in and around Johnston’s Court which is lined with Jewelers. The basement of Grays with its narrow staircase, and Under the Bridge on Talbot st are among my favourites.

*Go vintage shopping*

Dublin has a massive amount of charity shops and specialized vintage clothing shops. Walk up Camden street, South Great George’s st and Capel street, Phibsborough and you’ll pass dozens. I recommend the Kilo vintage shop in the basement of Lucy’s lounge vintage shop and play an arcade game while you’re down there. I got a 90s rave jacket in here for €7 mint condition. Price based on weight. Tola always has an amazing selection as does Flip(Helter Skelter), which is great for punk gear too. Sharpsville is one of the OG vintage places in Dublin as is Flip. Nine crows has great low price racks in the back off baggot st, with everything €15 or under. 

*Catch a gig or go to the theatre*

What I love about Dublin most of all is the small gigs in the basement or back room of century old buildings, you can feel the music vibrating through the floor up through your body. The music scene in Dublin right now is at its best in a long long time and has something to offer everybody.  The best venues for local acts or even just cheap acts in general are the Workman’s Club, Thomas House, Vicar Street, the Academy, Whelans.
Acts like The Murder Capital, Fontaine’s DC, Girlband, Kojaque, Versatile are all blowing up right now. It’s a great place to be musically.

I really recommend immersing yourself in Dublin’s deep history with plays and theatre by going to an Irish play, either from the 20th century or more contemporary. The Abbey is our national theatre but many smaller theatres have the same shows for half the price and a more personal setting, such as the Viking theatre in clontarf which is owned by the pub below it (bring up a pint!) and a few hidden through the city and Dun Laoighre. 

*Visit Dublin’s Outter neighbourhoods*

Tourists seem to think Dublin only exists between Christchurch and Merrion square, but the life of it exists right beyond those borders. You’ll find the pace immediately slows down, everything becomes more local and tourists disappear from sight. It’s what I’d describe as ‘proper Dublin’.

“HOWTH”

The perfect day trip. 30 minutes/€3 on the train. Start by exploring the Pier, and it’s many fishmongers. Stop for tea in the dog house, beneath an absorbed elevated tram platform. Explore the grounds of Howth Castle, with its meadows and forests, and behind the hotel where a portal tomb flown sits in a Rheodedandron garden (so beautiful I specifically recommend visiting Dublin in late may/early June just to see it in bloom) and traverse through this flowering, jungle like garden up a hill to the top for panoramic views of Howth, Dublin bay and the far-off Dublin mountains. Visit Ireland’s eye by boat, to get a glimpse of the west coast. Try find the abandoned church! Back on the mainland get a bus to the summit, and hike to the Bailey lighthouse. Decend to a hidden beach or continue rightward towards Sutton along the cliffs, with several more secret beaches on the way (easy to miss, keep an open eye) 

“Camden St”

A centre of local nightlife, and several graffiti filled alleyways (liberty lane, Camden row, Camden place,) and murals line the street, this is the centre of much of Dublin’s local nightlife, generally a great street with something for everybody. Walk south and you’re in Rathmines, walk north and you’re in George’s st, Parliament st and Capel st, all of which are worth visiting)

“Stonneybatter”

A traditional street and area, a mix of working and middle class, home to traditional shopfronts, good food spots and cafes and pubs. 

“Phibsborough, South Glasnevin, Drumcondra”

Gritty Phibsborough is great for pubs, charity shops and a walk around. Home to the blessington basin, a beautiful secluded park and several hipster haunts. 

South Glasnevin is centred around the Botanic gardens, with a breezy red brick traditional feel. A coffee at McMahons is great if only to look at the traditional shopfronts before walking around the Botanic Gardens. Drumcondra is the best of all worlds, with dense urban bustle to the south, a large leafy avenue with several  residential side streets with a few hidden cafes, an the beautiful Griffith Park where you can put your feet in the river and relax for the evening.

“Clontarf and Fairview” 

Clontarf is home to the Bull Island UNESCO listed nature reserve, connected to the mainland by a wooden bridge,  which also hosts a multi kilometre long beach and coffee outpost “happy out”. Clontarf also contains St Anne’s Park, former estate of the Guinness family which is dotted by abandoned tea temples and various hidden ruins. Clontarf castle and st John the Baptist cemetary are nice to walk around. Clontarf Promenade is also beautiful to walk along 

“Rathmines and Ranelagh”

Middle class Victorian suburbs on the Grand Canal, within walking distance of the city centre, a look at authentic Dublin. Lots of nice bakeries, chippers, pubs, cafes, restaurants.

“Portobello”

A beautiful wealthy residential district near the grand canal nice to walk a round

“Malahide”

A wealthy suburb accessible by train or bus. Home to a large marina, a castle and parkland, a quaint town centre with great food options. Also home to a beach of its own, and nearby Portmarnock beach. 

“Dun Laoghaire, Dalkey and Killiney”

Dun Laoghaire is a short hop on the train from the city centre. A regional centre of the suburbs, it has a strong town centre and a large harbour with a beautiful pier walk. Nearby is the Forty Foot, where Dublin’s regularly jump into the sea and the James Joyce museum located in an old Martello Tower fortification. Take the train south (or walk) to Uber wealthy Dalkey to explore it’s beautiful village centre which hosts multiple castles. Nearby Killiney Hill is a beautiful walk, as is Vico Road, a coastal road home to Dublin’s ultra wealthy. Have a picnic on Killiney beach. 

*Good coffee spots*

*Books Upstairs, a beautiful and peaceful cafe over a bookshop with a window seat that hangs over the street.

*Joy of Cha. Cosy tea house with a large shelf full of teas for you to chose from.

*Simons Place. A 70s style cafe. Popular with creatives, students, business people. Filled with posters and charm, and most importantly lunch and coffee for €5.90.

*Silk Road Cafe in The Chester Beatty Library has a revolving menu of dishes from the nations the museum’s Art originates from. 




Dublin is a dirty city, no doubt. And our nation is struggling with a major homelessness crisis, but it’s not even a fraction on the level of say Vancouver.

It’s not the countryside, we can’t stop for everybody but to say it’s too fast paced I think is flat out wrong. People seem to come here and expect the countryside because of the conotations of Ireland, but it’s a very Urban side to Ireland that doesn’t exist elsewhere in the republic. It’s different to the rest of the country. If you’re expecting Kerry from Dublin you’re not going to enjoy it.

If you have any questions or want me to elaborate on anything, about Ireland in general, please ask away. Hope this has been a good resource for when the pandemic is over.",solotravel,1593199554

doughqueen,hgz5yi,"Trip Report: Solo Road Trip to Santa Fe, New Mexico","Hi everyone! I wasn't going to write about this trip because it was my first one, not super well-planned and not very eventful. But, I'm stuck here in Houston for the long-foreseeable future and wanted to relive some happier times so here we go!

I took my first solo road trip from Houston, Texas to Santa Fe, New Mexico from January 2-6, 2020. It was completely on a whim after a rough first semester at graduate school so, like I said, it wasn't super well-planned. Luckily I have some friends in Alpine, Texas because I went to undergrad out there for a semester so I didn't have to do the drive all in one day (and got to have a great catch-up with some friends!). I was a little nervous because I'm a young female but it ended up going so well. So here is my schedule from those days, and I will follow it with some reflections and pictures: 

Day 1: Drove from Houston to Alpine, Texas. I took I-10. I chose this route over the north route because, like I said, I have friends there so I wouldn't have to pay for a place to stay overnight and I definitely wanted to take a break for safety reasons as I wasn't sure what road conditions would be like going into Santa Fe. Stayed in Alpine overnight, nothing too eventful. 

Day 2: Drove from Alpine to White Sands, New Mexico and spent an hour or two in White Sands. Then drove from White Sands to Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. Visited the brewery and bought some beer then finished my drive to Santa Fe. Got to my AirBnB at like... 7pm I think? Then went to get dinner at a nearby cafe where I tried red and green chile for the first time. 

Day 3: Started my morning by going to the Santa Fe railyard and farmer's market. Went to the Second Street brewery (as you can probably tell, I like beer), tried some brews and took a bottle home. Visited an art gallery in the area. Went to the Santa Fe plaza and walked around for a long time, visiting art galleries, the church and some shops. Had lunch at The Shed (amazing!) and then went to the Georgia O'Keefe Museum. Finished the evening by doing some work at a local coffee shop (I may have had dinner somewhere, but I truly can't remember and you'll find out why shortly). 

Day 4: Went to Museum Hill and visited the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture which I LOVED after an early lunch at the Museum Hill Cafe (overpriced TBH). Went to the emergency room because I had been getting progressively more sick over the past couple days (I thought it was just a cough from going into the dry air/higher altitude, and I tested negative for both flus and strep. So still a mystery). Went to MeowWolf and then had dinner at a sushi restaurant that I don't think I could ever remember the name of. But they gave me a free soup because my voice sounded really bad. Went back to the AirBnB praying to feel a little better before driving home in the morning. 

Day 5: Left my AirBnb around 10AM and began my drive to Austin, where I have family to stay with. I drove for like 13 hours straight I think? And on some level I'm honestly surprised that I made it. My cough ended up being so horrible that my ribs and back were aching terribly that night. Then I headed the rest of the way home the next day. 

Okay, WHEW. I think I crammed in a heck of a lot in those few days and yes, I was sick for a lot of it. I honestly have no clue what happened because I wasn't around anyone who was sick before I left and no one got sick when I got home. Some regrets that I have were, well, being sick. I also wish that I had someone to go to White Sands with because I was too scared to go too far into the dunes without someone to navigate with. It was still gorgeous and amazing but I definitely want to go back with someone. Same goes for MeowWolf, it was really awesome but even though I went in with the intention of following the story line, I ended up just wandering around because I was too overwhelmed to try and figure it out. I had plenty of hand sanitizer on me plus I had throat lozenges in my mouth the whole time so I didn't do a whole lot of coughing while I was there. I also wanted to go to some springs or some parks but didn't have the time. The drive back was really stressful because of how sick I felt, and I'm sad that I had to rush to Austin because I passed through some really cool looking small towns on the way out of New Mexico, including the town with the Billy the Kid museum and grave. So bummed I couldn't stop there but I had fun looking up the towns on my stops. 

Other than that though, I loved every second of it. It had freshly snowed when I got there, and it was enough snow that I got to see some beautiful views but not enough that it made it dangerous to drive. The museums and art galleries I visited were amazing. I also stayed at a great AirBnB in this huge house with several guests staying in it. The owner is an artist and him and his wife were so kind. I only wish I had gotten to get to know them and the other guests more, but I mostly holed myself up in my room because I felt pretty crappy by like day 3. I also discovered how much I love driving long distances, which I was nervous about because I'm a generally anxious person and have trouble being alone with my thoughts so I wasn't sure how well I would tolerate it. Plus I had a lot of great film photography practice out there and got some great beers! Speaking of photography, while I was in the Plaza I met an older man who noticed my camera and we had a chat about film photography for about a half hour. He gave me his recipe for homemade film developer and we followed each other on social media. Just a funny story that I like to look back on. I met some super nice people there.

As far as budget goes, I saved a LOT of money on the way there by bringing my own food. I brought some uncrustable sandwiches, applesauce pouches, water and fruit snacks. I think I brought other stuff too but I can't remember. My airbnb was affordable too, I think I only spend $100 for the three nights I was there and it was the perfect accommodation for me. The MeowWolf ticket was a little expensive, but I didn't spend all that much on food while I was there either because I only ate 1-2 actual meals per day. Other food that I ate was more like snack. They have some AMAZING food in Santa Fe. Of course, now I have some medical bills to take care of. Blah. But the people at St. Vincent's were some of the nicest nurses and doctors I've ever met and made me feel so much safer because being alone in a strange city while sick is super scary! So if you're gonna be sick in Santa Fe and there's no urgent care clinics open, I recommend them (lol). 

Overall, I loved the trip and I never once felt unsafe, which was a concern not so much for me but for my family and friends. If you're a young lady looking for somewhere in the US to visit solo for the first time, Santa Fe is a great option. 

And finally, here's a few of my favorite 35mm shots I took on the trip! None are edited so if they don't look super clean and professional, I'm sorry lol [https://imgur.com/a/gHb4R4b](https://imgur.com/a/gHb4R4b)

anguslearns2do,hgzyg7,The 3-country border - Weil am Rhein (Germany side)," To circle southern half of Germany in 15 days, I let go settling along River Rhine. After Heidelberg, I short-break in Offenburg and Freiburg and head directly to Weil am Rhein.

Weil am Rhein is great choice for solo travel in my opinion. It’s right at the triple border of France, Switzerland, and Germany. Hopping across the 3 countries for junk food is really really fun. Besides, accommodation is very economical (By CAD$60, I check-in a real hotel that can see Switzerland from my room with unlimited smoked salmon in the included buffet breakfast). 

Scenic points may be limited within the city. Consider Vitro Design Museum. It can be a great surprise. Amazing designs cover all aspects of life. When I feel hungry and check time, I spent 4 hours in it already. Totally mind refreshing. Rate 4.5/5

 \*note: If you have time, try the $5 full tour. It seems you can access the factory building and witness production lines of many famous products. If you do, please share the experience with me.

charlykatbat,hh026c,Solo hiking in times of Corona.,"Hello you beautiful people.
As 2020 is one hell of a weird year I had to make some drastic changes in my summer planning.
My original plan was to fly to Scotland and hike the west highland way and then continue on the east highland way (in total around 300 km). But since Corona I decided to scrap that plan.
I still want to go hiking this year, so I started looking into alternative routes in more safe countries and decided on north East Germany (the so called mecklenburgische Seenplatte to be precise). I've opted for a route not following any premarket hiking paths and only passing smaller villages (and one bigger town) on my 150 km stretch, as I've thought staying away from popular tourist spots and big beaches would hopefully help me stay isolated and not having to wear a mask 24/7 (I'm still bringing one, but I'd rather enjoy the fresh air within the forests). 
Now I'm just wondering if you guys think my plan would be a good idea, or if I should just stay away from traveling this summer (I'd be hiking in August) all together.
I've opted for mid to late August, since the school holidays will be over in most of Germany and hopefully most tourists will already have returned home, but I'm still unsure.
I'll be tent camping the whole route, so I don't have to worry about hotels/hostels not being clean.
Any help or suggestions on areas that are safe are highly appreciated.",solotravel,1593287044

Lather,hi2c6d,Where do I go next? Ireland - Spain - Italy,"Hello guys! I'm looking to do some solo travelling in September. I'll be travelling from a London airport.

I've narrowed my destination list down to Ireland, Spain and Italy, although **I am open to other suggestions**.

**The places I've been to**: New York, Germany (Hamburg, Cologne), Copenhagen, Netherlands (Rotterdam, Amsterdam), and Greece (Athens, Meteora). I didn't like Athens very much, but Meteora was unrelentingly beautiful. Even the 4 hour train journey there was like being on another planet. I'd been very against going to hot countries up until then, but if somewhere can match Meteora in beauty, culture and history, I'd go there in a heartbeat. 

Length: Around a week, give or take. I hope to travel to at least two different areas with the country I go to. 3 if it's Ireland.

Budget: Fairly tight budget of around £400-500. I'll be staying in hostels the entire time, and will be cooking most of my own food. I may eat out once or twice. Most of the budget will be spent on travel, and maybe a couple of tours. Return flights to both Italy and Spain are roughly £40 - 70 for me, with Dublin being around £30.

Climate: Nothing over 30 degrees Celsius. Luckily I'm travelling in September so Spain/Italy won't be overbearingly hot, and Ireland won't be too cold.  

Interests: Culture, history and nature. I'm not the biggest fan of museums, but I do enjoy walking and learning about a place. Food isn't super important, as I won't be eating out much. 

Safety: Safety is a bit of a concern. It's why I quite like guided tours as you're always with someone knowledgeable, but I won't be able to afford that this time.

Mechach,grn7d4,Distance biking in Spain,"Hello everyone!

While under quarantine, I've spent probably way too much time daydreaming about my next trip (I'm sure I'm not alone in this). I've also been biking like crazy, and it put the idea into my head to try to plan a long distance bike trip for whenever this craziness calms down. In the most optimistic case, this would be in mid October, and I'd take about 2 weeks. More likely would be early next spring.

My current thoughts were to try to do Andalucia, with Seville, Malaga, and Grenada on the itinerary (I've already seen Gibraltar, so i was going to skip that), and maybe heading up the coast if I'm feeling ambitious.

Does anyone know how this might go in Spain? I'm hoping to be able to bring a comfortable amount of equipment along to do en-route repairs, but is this kind of thing normally doable in this area? Are bike lanes outside of cities common, and are the roads generally paved well enough that a bike wouldn't have too many problems? Also, am I underestimating how hard the hills might be in that region? I'm coming from Michigan, US (read: completely flat).",solotravel,1590597799

alphascience77,grqlac,Finally doing it but unsure,"For a couple of years I've lurked on this sub, dreaming of when I'll solo travel for the first time. I've finally decided to make my dreams official and I'm starting to plan my trip. This is *a lot* harder than I thought it would be lol.

So the trip is going to take place next summer (my last summer before college) and my planned budget is $4000 after I've bought the ticket (if i plan on going outside of the country). So I'll have \~2 months to spread that money out. The only problem is that I can't decide on what to do, here's a list  of what's on my mind.

* I love hiking and photography, so a lot of my time is going to be spent hiking and just exploring in general. I also love kayaking and white water rafting.
* I'm not much of a beach or tropical person. I love mountains so places like Oregon, Iceland, British Columbia, etc. really excite me.
* Iceland and New Zealand are two countries very high on my list but there's two issues with those. 1) I'll be too young to rent a car so I'm worried I won't have as much freedom as I'd like.                   2) I know those countries are quite expensive so I wouldn't be able to spend as much time there as I would be able to in other countries.
* A road-trip through the U.S ( mainly on the west coast since the only thing that interests me on the East are the cities which with everything going on I'm not sure if that will be viable). This would be good because I've only been to northern Cali, Tennessee, Alabama, and NYC. I would be able to see more of what this country has to offer. I already have a reliable car so my main expense would be gas/food. The only downside to this is that I'm not sure if I would want to do that solo because I don't know how easy it is to meet people with the lack of hostel culture (yes I know couch surfing is sort of prevalent but I'm not sure if that's a good alternative so let me know if you have any experience with that)

So the road-trip through the U.S is what I'm leaning towards but the main reasons I'm not sure about that is I wouldn't be able to experience much of other cultures and the other thing I talked about above. Any advice would be super helpful, if I didn't give enough info just ask and I'll answer pretty quickly. Thanks!",solotravel,1590608019
special_leather,grsd3v,Best place to solo travel after a break up?,"Hi there! So as title says, I am looking for a solo trip after a break up (and whenever pandemic issues subside enough to travel safely). What places do you recommend as a good place for a first solo trip internationally? I am in California and have only done solo road trips within the US, never out of country. But have loved every second on the road by myself. I think an international solo trip will do wonders for my self esteem and sense of inner peace. 

My partner and I were supposed to go to Iceland for an epic road trip in a few weeks and we were insanely stoked, but then covid and break up happened. 

I am looking mainly for hiking, unique natural landscapes to play in and find plants and animals, interesting cityscapes, and anywhere that I can realistically travel and enjoy in 2 weeks (damn you American PTO system!!). Immersing myself into a new culture and punishing my body with vigorous exercise in another country is what I consider fun.  I prefer to rent a personal car when I travel,  but am open to areas where trains are reliable/safe. I am thinking SEA, Central America, Philippines, or Scandinavia   but am open to any and all recommendations!

OurBernard45,gsab35,1 Week Trip to Kyiv Last October!,"I’ve been meaning to post info that I would’ve appreciated before traveling there solo for a while, but until quarantine always had an excuse to procrastinate. Just for context I’m an American male and this was my first time traveling solo. Also I spoke enough Russian to order food, tell people I don’t speak Russian or Ukrainian, and read street signs/menus/metro stops. I’m better now and really improved when I was over there. 

Before I get into the details of the trip and what I learned from it, I loved Kyiv. The city is amazing with tons to do and really really good food. Also coffee is everywhere. Also also if you’re considering it there’s a really good YouTube channel called Visit Kyiv that puts out great videos including museums, how to get into town from the airport, and best restaurants for different budgets. I watched all of them and having that foresight was extremely helpful.

Accomodation

I stayed at Zig Zag hostel which was a real mixed bag. On the one hand, it was super centrally located. Just down the block from Taras Schevchenko park, I could be just about anywhere in the city in 15 minutes if I took the metro. On the other hand it was not the hostel environment you might picture if you’ve never stayed in one. I chose the 4 person all male dorm, which was a good pick, and met a few people, but there was no real sense of community. I tried hanging out in the common space to meet people, but that mainly led to chatting with some crazies who were staying there. I helped one of the guys I met move his stuff to the DREAM hostel, which was less centrally located, but was definitely more young backpackers looking to hang out.

Getting Around

I love walking, and think it’s a great way to explore new cities, so I would typically walk places. The metro was great though, and I’d highly recommend taking it to see some of the really cool artwork. Every station had a few stalls that accepted tap-and-go credit cards which was super convenient. Also just as an aside, the escalators moved way faster than the ones here in the US. 

Food

All of the food was incredible. I’m a big fan of Eastern European food in general, and the range of cuisines was honestly surprising. Puzata Hata was a cafeteria-style Ukrainian place, and there were several throughout the city. There’s an excellent Georgian place near the Vauxhall station that wasn’t even on Google Maps called Little Georgian Cafe. Musafir is a Crimean place with amazing duck breast. Lviv Croissant is a bistro chain with amazing breakfast sandwiches. And the last one I’ll plug was O’panas in Taras Schevchenko park, which is traditional Ukrainian with folk music, outfits, and food. 

Coffee is eeeverywhere, and most of it is really good.

Things That Were Surprising

- The most surprising thing to me was the toilets and lack of toilet paper. Obviously something that others may have looked up or assumed, I was not expecting the hole-in-the-ground toilets to be the most easily found. Also the lack of available toilet paper, so just prepare accordingly.

- Parking seemed to be wherever you felt like leaving your vehicle. I saw dozens of Range Rovers each day parked with one wheel up on the curb. There were also many unmarked, shared sidewalks where cars and people were moving together. So stay aware of your surroundings. 

- The number of underground shops and the underground mall. Most, if not all, major intersections on and near the main stretch (Khreschatyk Street) have underground passages to cross, and all of these had dozens of little shops, stores, and restaurants or takeaways. Most were open pretty late which was super convenient.

- I was asked for directions 3 separate times by locals, or Russian/Ukrainians. The first morning I was approached by a woman and her 8 year old son and managed to stammer that I didn't speak Ukrainian, which her son openly laughed at. In retrospect it was hilarious, but not a great start.

- Not Kyiv specific but getting used to doing things alone, and being comfortable interacting in a language I barely spoke, was a much larger adjustment than I had anticipated. It initially felt as though everyone else was in on a joke, but I realized after a couple days that I was the only one who was focused on me being foreign.

Trip Details

Length: 1 week, all spent in Kyiv which was a great amount of time to really get to know the city

Bag(s): 55L Patagonia Blackhole bag with a drawstring backpack for essentials

Packing list: 2 pairs of jeans, denim jacket, insulated vest for layering, 3 long sleeve t-shirts, 3 short sleeve t-shirts, 2 shortsleeved button down shirts, 1 pair of joggers, 7 pair lightweight boxer briefs, 1 pair of chukka boots (wouldn’t bring on my next trip, too bulky), 1 pair canvas tennis shoes, 7 pair socks

Phone: Bought SIM at store near hostel, easy install. Went with Vodafone, but there were 3 different options.

Money: Brought some US cash, and had to withdraw a couple times, but most places took credit

Went on one bar crawl and would highly recommend it, met lots of fun backpackers and tourists and the hosts were great! It was through Kyiv Pub Crawls if you’re interested.

Hostelworld has historically been a pretty good company, and I didn't want to do file a dispute, but them saying they're going to hold on to my money for a year isn't acceptable and makes me think there is a good chance they will go out of business before I got my refund.

I had been planning a South America backpacking trip before the coronavirus crisis blew up into a global issue, and have been trying to understand how hostels will operate in the coming months/years. I checked the webpage for Selina Hostels, a popular chain in South America that has enormous properties with perhaps hundreds and hundreds of beds per location. You can see their page on safety/cleanliness \[here.\]([https://info.selina.com/safety-and-cleanliness/?\_ga=2.97343391.1432081194.1590757345-1869279667.1590757345&amp;\_gac=1.52103771.1590757345.CjwKCAjw5cL2BRASEiwAENqAPiGMDPfv5hhEw0jK2Ij3\_VGN6EK52-7TME-Uqd\_4D6kxPpTdNrzh6hoCzuUQAvD\_BwE](https://info.selina.com/safety-and-cleanliness/?_ga=2.97343391.1432081194.1590757345-1869279667.1590757345&amp;_gac=1.52103771.1590757345.CjwKCAjw5cL2BRASEiwAENqAPiGMDPfv5hhEw0jK2Ij3_VGN6EK52-7TME-Uqd_4D6kxPpTdNrzh6hoCzuUQAvD_BwE))

The highlights:

4 bed rooms will only accept 2-4 people from the same party

6 bed rooms will only accept 2 people

8+ bed rooms will run at 25% capacity and will only accept parties of 2+ people

As a true solo traveler, this feels like a dealbreaker. The people you meet in your rooms often become your friends during your stay. And with all of the limits on capacity the hostels will basically be empty and void of the social energy that is so central to the overall experience.

misstheground12,gst2ns,Just got back - 3 1/2 months Traveling in India. Tips for traveling light and India Specific Travel Tips,"I just got back from traveling in India for three and a half months. I'm not going to get into too much detail about the actual trip itself in this post (obviously it got weird with corona), but I did want to write a little thing about tips for traveling light, and travel tips for India specifically. This is aimed at people who haven't solo traveled before. 


My main thing is to travel as light as possible. These tips assume a generally warm climate, although I did experience temps down in the 60's in certain places (feels very cold after 90's) and still did fine. Obviously this is just the way I tend to travel, every does it their own way, but maybe some newer travelers will find some things here helpful.


First off, the advantages of traveling light are pretty obvious. You do a ton of walking while traveling, and it's just less exhausting to have a lighter pack to lug around while you're lost, wandering for miles around the chaotic unmarked streets of Bangalore in 95 degree heat while all the scooters in the city weave around you and blare their illegally amplified horns in unison as they pass by. You also don't have to check any luggage and therefore don't have to worry about your luggage getting lost. You don't have to worry about someone putting your bag up on the roof of the bus where you can't keep an eye on it because you can just keep it in your lap or at your feet. It's also just easier to have fewer things - one bag to keep track of instead of two, and if you're looking for something, it's much easier to find it in a small pack than rifling through something twice as big.


My number one tip for traveling light is to limit yourself to a normal (or small) backpack, because you will fill whatever backpack you bring. A small backpack guarantees that you'll only be able to fill that one small backpack, and you'll automatically force yourself to think more carefully about what you absolutely need. When packing, air is your enemy. Squish everything down as small as it will go. If you have snacks in bags that are mostly air, fuck that. Open them and put the snacks in a ziploc, or user rubber bands to close them again, and get all that goddamn air out. It sounds a little crazy, but small pockets of air add up really quickly.


This will happen naturally, but put the things you aren't going to use much in less accessible places, and the things you're using all the time in the most accessible places. I never have debit cards/credit cards in my wallet, only cash. I also put most of the cash I get from the ATM back into the backpack, and only carry a little bit at a time. If you really can't fit something into your pack, and you really need to bring it, you can strap it to the outside of the pack. I did this a lot with my nalgene and sometimes with my sweatshirt.


For footwear, just bring one pair of sandals if at all possible. Shoes take up more room than sandals, and they come with socks, which also take up room, and you have to wash the socks. You may think that's crazy, but small things like socks add up quickly in a small pack and rob you of precious space. On this trip I brought TWO pairs of shoes (One pair for walking, one for running) as well as a terrible pair of flip flops that cut my feet. I'd suggest you just bring shitty flip flops and buy sandals on day one. Then either ditch the flip flops or keep them for showering if you really want them. I bought sandals for 300 rupees ($5) that are still going strong and ditched the flip flops and second pair of shoes. The pair of shoes I hung on to largely lived in the bottom of the pack, just taking up space. The sandals I bought were velcro; I'd say don't buy velcro. Go with a gummy or a buckle (like the locals use). The velcro comes undone way too much.


Bring as few clothes as possible. My wardrobe was one pair of shorts, one pair of pants (jeans), one t-shirt, one long-sleeved t-shirt, a few pairs of socks, a few pairs of underwear, a hooded sweatshirt, winter gloves, and a hat. If you're walking around in a hot climate with nothing to change into, you're going to be sweating balls and will want to wash your clothes fairly often. To wash, you can shower with your clothes on (using soap on your clothes), or just jump in the river, lake, stream, or ocean with your clothes on. In a hot climate, this will help keep you cool, and the clothes will dry very quickly and be sort of clean (won't stink at least). If you don't want to be wearing wet clothes for a little bit, just wash them in the shower with soap, wring them out, and hang them up. Also, all your clothing should be light. I brought jeans and thick shorts, and both took up too much room, were heavier, and took way longer to dry because of how thick they were. A sweatshirt is obviously great for warmth if it's a chilly night, but it also can act as a pillow, a towel, and ground cover. After the first few weeks I wasn't using any underwear at all. Ditch it. Don't choose white for your one t-shirt like I did, unless you want to know exactly how poorly you're cleaning job is. I had brought the hat and gloves because I live in Maine and brought them on the way to the airport, but they actually were super nice to have for the ""chilly"" nights when it got down into the 60's. I'd often go short sleeves during the day, then long sleeves at night as it gold cooler and the mosquitoes came out.


Going against the second biggest piece of advice from Hitchiker's Guide To The Galaxy, I didn't bring a towel. In hot climates you dry so quickly, you don't need it. If it's super humid, you're going to be kind of wet all the time anyway. You can also just use your sweatshirt or your long sleeve to dry if you really need to. Wiping the water down your body or shaking the water off works pretty well.


Resealable ziploc bags (with the little slider nub) are amazing for a lot of things. I brought twenty of them stuffed into a little pocket. They can be garbage bags, they can let you easily organize your items while keeping them visible (toiletries, electronics), they can isolate items that might get messy if opened (sun block, hand sanitizer), they can hold snacks that you've opened or leftovers you want to save from the bugs, they can be used to (sort of) water-proof your phone when you go on river excursions with shorts that have shitty pockets.


Shampoo is just foamy soap. You can just use soap. Or don't wash your hair. After a few days it won't even be greasy. Bar soap also works fine for washing clothes. Just get it sudsy and go to town. You can also easily buy most things there for much cheaper than here, like a power adapter (a few dollars), bar soap (20 cents), a toothbrush (20 cents), and toothpase (50 cents?). Tweezers and nail clippers are great for getting splinters out.


On travel days, I usually buy a bottle of water to have along with my nalgene. A 2L of water is cheap, but very awkward to transport because of how big it is. Better to just get the 1L.


Tape is helpful to have. Among a million other things, I used it to make new backpack zipper handles when mine started to break. Duct tape is my go-to, but it turns out it's not good for fixing mosquito net holes. Medical tape was way better. 


I used the reading light a lot, as well as the flash light. It's good to have alternatives to your phone in a case it's dead. Tweezers and nail clippers are very helpful for getting splinters out or sharpening your pencil with the nail filer if your cheap pens shit out on you and you're in the jungle. I used bandaids a lot after scratching mosquito bites until they bled. I didn't use the ear plugs, but probably should have. I definitely didn't need a whole package of them. Also didn't really use the bug lotion, but should have. Did use the antibiotics in Varanasi and was glad to have them. Used a lot of sun block, and have been told it's hard to get in India but I didn't notice if it was/wasn't.


A frisbee is a great way to meet locals and takes up very little space in your pack. It's especially good if you can do really simple tricks with it on your own while you wait for a partner. When someone walks by, just gesture at them and show them how to catch it with two hands. If they seem halfway eager, throw them a toss. I had amazing sessions with people you would never expect to be interested - a 50 year old villager tossed with me for 20 minutes, the first half with a machete in his other hand, which made me very nervous.


Some items I could have used: I brought a book instead of a kindle because my trip was kind of impromptu. Obviously a kindle is going to take up way less space and hold many more books. I did start reading ebooks on my phone, so there's that, but it strains your eyes more than a kindle would and drains the phone battery. My reading light died, and I didn't have any replacement flat batteries. I could have used a small cloth bag for a day pack. It would have been super cheap to just buy one there, but I never did. I made an awkward day pack out of a ziploc bag and duct tape, but it was pretty ugly.


I went with Schwab for my debit card, and Venture Capital One for my credit card. Schwab was great - they reimburse ATM fees. I did seem to struggle, like many people, to get money from Bank of India ATM's. 


Venture was absolute garbage for me. They blocked the majority of my transactions as fraud, even though I expressly told them I would be traveling in India. When I reached them by phone, they wanted me to verify my identity by sending an SMS to my US number, which was impossible because I was in India with the Indian sim card. Unlike every other company ever, they were completely unwilling to verify by email. They finally let me verify by taking a picture of my driver's license, weird, but glad it worked out. Anyway, sometimes even when I was on the phone with them while trying to make a purchase from the jungle when the holy trinity of having power and internet service and a short hold time all miraculously converged, they would be unable to stop the purchase from being blocked, telling me that ""that's how our fraud prevention system works"". Terrible. 


Psychological stuff:


I guess this doesn't apply to solo travel, but if you're thinking about traveling with someone you haven't traveled with long-term before - try going on a weekend trip with them somewhere to see how they travel, how they plan, how they handle unexpected issues. I briefly traveled with a guy who hated making plans and would just change everything at the last minute and you had to follow his lead or he would just ditch you....it was fucking tiring for me, but maybe for someone else that's perfect. Accept when plans change or don't work out. It will happen. Wherever you go it's most likely crazy and different than your home country anyway, even if it's just the train station floor where you'll be sleeping that night because the city took over all the hotels that day to use for quarantining suspected coronavirus cases.


India Specific:


A smartphone is essential and baked into normal Indian daily life. Buy train tickets (IRCTC), figure out how many hours late your train is running (Rail Yatri / Where Is My Train), get taxis/rickshaws (Ola/Uber), find trails (Maps Me), Make sure your phone can handle 4G in India (many American phones can't, because it's a different wireless band or something). Mine was comptable with India, but only 3G, so I had terrible slow internet the whole time, so check that, too. There are many articles talking about getting an Indian number. It's dumb and annoying but worth it. Even most free wifi in India requires you being able to receive an SMS code, so you can't get the free wifi without an Indian phone number. Something I was unaware of is that India will turn your sim card off after 3 months, saying that it's because your visa is expiring, even if you're on a longer visa. So just be ready for that if you're staying longer. I got a text that my plan was expiring, added 2 more months to it, then a day later got a text saying they were shutting the sim down because of my visa. Luckily the plans are cheap as hell (like $10 for 3 months), but still. Fuck you Vodafone.


To buy train tickets online, you need an account through IRCTC, which seems to have been created by a drunk twelve year old. It is possible to get an account and to actually buy tickets with an American credit card. I believe there are sites dedicated to explaining this. One weird thing I noticed is that when you're registering your account, when it just says ""Country"" it means the country of the phone number you're using, so put ""India"". Otherwise you get an error and it doesn't tell you why it isn't working. When you go to pay for a ticket there are 8 different options for 3rd party payment processing. Sometimes one will work and sometimes it won't. I literally got an error that said ""Some error has occurred"". This shit is also constantly changing, so get someone to help you if at all possible.


The cheapest places to stay are not online, but it's good to have a few backups in mind if you can't find a cheap place for whatever reason. For example - in Gokarna there are a string of places right on the beach that are R200 ($3.50) a night for a private room, much cheaper than the dorms in hostels that are listed online.


People speak English, but it might be so accented that you struggle to understand, and they also struggle to understand you. It's basically a creole, and if you don't speak it with the right accent, they have no idea what you're saying. I kept saying BTM Layout - ""Bee Tee Em Layout"" and no one understood me. Finally I pointed to a sign, and they said, ""OOOH. Beedeem!""


Always, always ask if you're unsure. Ask multiple people, try to get a consensus. Do not trust one person's answer. Indians love to seem helpful, even if they have no fucking clue. Do not trust google maps in India. It was wrong so many times. Like the thing is on the other side of a really crazy busy street, or not there at all. I walked about a mile in pretty hot weather to an ATM on google maps, and when I got there it was clear there hadn't even been a building there for ten years. 

 
Don't do Holi in Varanasi, or probably any city, especially if you're a woman. It's just a hassle at best and dangerous at worst. I got my balls grabbed from behind by a dude on a scooter. The women with us got aggressively and repeatedly hugged and had to slap a lot of drunk Indians.


On very full trains, general class spills into sleeper class. If you're not assertive you might be sharing your bed with other people, and there will be literally no floor space because it will be full of bodies and you'll have to basically rock climb over them to get to the bathroom.


Don't eat cold street food in Varanasi (Or any street food). Everyone I met in Varanasi had been eating street food all over India, and convinced me to eat it in Varanasi, and then all of us got sick. Very shitty.


I took pictures of what I came back with. As you can see, I added things that took up more room, and still had space in the pack. I'll put captions on the pictures, but briefly it was clothes, nalgene, shoes, sandals, toiletries, tape, reading light, charger, adapter, bug spray, notebooks, bamboo water bottle souvenir, indian print dress souvenir, camera, snacks, souvenir honey split into 3 bottles for TSA regulations, ziploc bags, compass, flashlight, wallet, mp3 player, glasses case, pens, book,

objectivecranberry20,gswj5m,Not sure which airline to choose (KRK - FRA - BKK),"I have a choice between Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian and Air France. They’re similarly priced. Starting from Kraków Balice with change in Frankfurt and then straight to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi.

I’m tempted to go with DLH772 flight, but I’m not sure how Lufthansa’s economy class holds up to the rest.

I’m about 173cm/5’8 tall so I’m not worried about leg space in any of those because even flying cheap crappy airlines like Ryanair or Wizz I’ve never had an issue with it. The most I’m worried about is the comfort, availability of FlyNet, USB port for charging phone and possibly a tablet/laptop and how big of a powerbank you can take onboard.

With those crap airlines they allow you to take max of 10,000mAh powerbank on board but they’re forbidding you from charging your devices during the flight.

I’d also like to know how big of a hand luggage you can take, or if you can have additional personal bag etc., since I’d really like to avoid checked baggage. Showing up earlier to the airport, worrying whether they lost/damaged it etc.

So, any options on those airlines on long (9h) flights?",solotravel,1590770998

I'm the only one who is single and hasn't had kids. Previously, I had a boyfriend who was very adventurous. While I would ask my friends if they would want to come, they wouldn't. So, I was able to go with that boyfriend. 

That boyfriend and I had split up and I continued to ask my friends if they would want to go on my upcoming trips. They would decline. These trips did not always require a domestic flight and some were just weekend or even day trip getaways. I did go on a few less than 2 hours away ones without them. Not once did my friends make plans to come with. 

I had them over at my house a few nights ago and they made me feel somewhat *bad* about the life I live. They said they just can't do all these things because they have *responsibilities* now and have to be *adults*. I was really taken aback. I told them that besides not having a child, I have responsibilities and that planning these trips is not always walk in the park - in terms of finding ways to make them work with daily obligations. 

It just sounds like they like the idea of travelling with me and getting away, going on a vacation, etc...but when it comes down to it they don't bite. They don't want to go through making arrangements for their children, calling off work, etc.

helpwitheating,gtq9fg,PSA: First class tickets are cheap right now. But you probably won't actually be flying first class.,"One of my relatives isn't doing well and I am trying to go see them in the fall. Unfortunately, this trip would involve flying. Not ideal during a pandemic. I have some savings and was thinking about trying to go first class. The tickets seemed so cheap and the seats are farther apart. I saw all of the photos of economy class jammed packed and no one enforcing mask rules, so no seat is safe, but these ones seemed just a tiny bit safer. Most air filtration systems on planes go from front to back, so according to some articles I read, sitting closer to the front is safer. I booked a flight and on it no seats in first class were coming up as taken. I would be at least six feet away from other people. It seemed like the safest possibly option.

A week later, I got an email that the flight information had been updated. It was now a much smaller plane doing the flight. Still, my seat was in first class (bigger seats further apart) and it looked empty.

Yesterday I got another email. The flight information had been updated again. Now, the flight will happen on a tiny plane that is showing almost all the seats as full. There are no cabins and the seats are all the same distance apart. Also, it was now in two legs with a transfer through a very busy airport. I feel unsafe going into an airport to begin with. This one is frequented by American travellers. I cancelled for now and was able to get a refund. I find this annoying, given that the airline I chose just got a massive government bailout and fuel is cheaper than ever. Packing people in during a pandemic doesn't seem fair.

Flying is unsafe right now period, but flying on a full, tiny, old plane seems especially dangerous. So I'm not going for now, unless something changes. I wished countries actually enforced their new regulations on planes so that it was safe to fly. I've also just heard horror stories from a friend who had to fly home recently. The person sitting next to her took off his mask and coughed quite frequently. The airplane staff did nothing, and the flight was full, so there was nowhere she could go. That in combination with the new tiny plane has scared me off flying until there's a vaccine.

It may be possible for me to take a train out to see my family member in my own cabin with a window that opens. It would just take about seven days, so that's not ideal either. Still looking into different options.",solotravel,1590888999

This sub receives a lot of posts from people worried about coronavirus and how it affects their travel plans. Your friendly r/solotravel mods have assembled the following FAQ. Please read this first, and please use this thread to post any of your travel questions related to the coronavirus pandemic.

Note: This is an updated megathread as of April 27, 2020. You can find earlier megatheads here: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/evscdp/coronavirus_faq_the_megathread/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/f8zf6x/coronavirus_faq_the_megathread_updated/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/fhla6x/coronavirus_faq_the_megathread_3/).

**Is it still OK to travel right now?**

In light of the global pandemic and the recommendations of many major governments around the world, our official stance is that you should avoid all essential travel, including domestic travel, until the pandemic has been brought under control.

**When will borders open up? Will I be able to take my planned trip to [country] in [month]?**

The hard truth is that ***no one knows***. It is unclear when borders will reopen. Although some countries have announced that their lockdown measures are valid until a given date, past experience has so far shown that these end dates are unreliable and frequently subject to last-minute extensions.

Even if you are able to physically reach your destination, there may be mandatory quarantine requirements as well as significant restrictions on mobility, tourism, and other aspects of everyday life (e.g. closures, curfews, or mask requirements).

At this point in time, a return to 'normal' in international travel for this summer appears extremely unlikely. Although no one can say for sure, it seems likely that significant restrictions on international travel may continue until at least the end of 2020.

**What is the current border situation in [destination country]?**

See [this comprehensive list](https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm) updated regularly by the IATA (International Air Transport Association). Note that this site is only a third party providing a brief overview. As always, cross check with official government sources.

**What steps can I take to protect myself if I do have to travel?**

The WHO recommends standard common-sense protection measures, such as maintaining basic hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe food practices and avoiding close contact, when possible, with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.

MuskoxDee,g96gsn,Looking ahead...,"I've never been home for so long and while it's nice to have a weed free garden and an organized house,  I can't wait to travel again.  I'm 71 so I know I don't have that many years left to explore this world.

I think it's going to be quite a few months till other countries are willing to admit US citizens...our country, after all, has the most cases.  US travel should be possible sooner.

I'm thinking my first opportunity might be a road trip from the SF Bay Area to Oregon.  When our SIP is lifted I'm thinking that might be doable.  If restaurants aren't open I could do drive-thrus or take outs.  But I guess I'll have to wait till AirBNB is operating normally - or could stay in motels?  I'd pack my own pillow and a ton of cleaning supplies.  Renting a little rv would work, too...but I really like driving my own car.

I was supposed to fly to Shanghai this week and stay in a hotel overlooking the river and the Bund, followed by a 28 day cruise around Asia...thinking about a future trip helps ease the disappointment a bit.

I'm just musing here but I'd like to know what others have planned and any ideas on how to ease back into safe, practical, possible traveling.",solotravel,1588012421

velveeta-shells,g9f33c,22 y/o F from USA- advice for a night in Lisbon?,"hey all! I know with COVID-19 this trip may or may not happen, but I’m trying to plan ahead on the off-chance that my flights don’t get cancelled.

this fall I’m going to be in Europe for about 6 weeks, and my flight back to the US has an overnight layover in Lisbon. I’m spending the night there, and then heading back to the airport the next afternoon. I have a few questions pertaining to that time:

1. I’ll be getting in late so I feel like I shouldn’t use a hostel in order to not be coming in and disturbing people after lights are out... as a 22 y/o American female, would an Airbnb be safe for me to use in Lisbon, or should I find a hotel? I prefer both the price and the experience of Airbnb, but obviously safety is the priority.

2. I don’t speak more than a few words of Portuguese. I plan on learning some basic phrases before I go just so I can get myself around the city safely- if I know English and Spanish in addition to that very basic Portuguese, will that be enough for most interactions, like speaking to a taxi driver or asking for directions? I’ve heard English is popular there but I don’t want to seem like “that American” who assumes everyone knows my language.

3. any other tips or advice? I only have part of a day, so it’s going to be a pretty short itinerary- are there any must-see places (near the city centre)? any places to avoid, due to safety or just being overrated? best way to get around the city?

this is my first time in Europe on my own &amp; my first time in Portugal altogether, so I appreciate anything you guys have to offer- thanks in advance!",solotravel,1588041916

Wutaang,g9mdu0,"If travel bans (Covid) were lifted , would you still travel this year ?","Hi guys. For context, I’m 22 and just about to graduate from university. I’ve been working relentlessly alongside my school and uni career since I was about 14, as well as made a few investments all in order to save up for travelling. I’ve been financially preparing for this pretty much my whole life so I can buy a one way ticket and go nomadic until my money runs out (which I assume could be Atleast 2 years).. then come back and settle down and get a ‘proper’ job. Obviously that can’t happen now because of corona 😤

If you guys:
- had more than enough money to travel for 2ish years 
- had only one shot to go proper nomadic in your life before you settle down with family , job etc
- no real rush to leave (apart from boredom) as I don’t have a graduate job lined up

Would you still travel this year?

I’m just worried that if I go as soon as bans are lifted, I won’t be making the most of my ‘one shot’ before settling down. Places will be quiet and people will be nervous in the post corona wake. 

I was thinking of just chilling here at home, doing a few part time jobs to keep me busy , then waiting til next year ? On one hand i don’t want this experience to be tainted in the post corona wake... on the other hand, it seems a waste to wait another year when I could leave tomorrow (money wise)!!?

So, I am graduating this December with a BA and decide that as a gift for myself I shall treat myself to a trip somewhere exotic where I haven't been before. 

My travel experience is limited to multiple European countries, USA and Morocco. That's it. Never been anywhere else. I'm not gonna lie, long plane flights freak me out. I can't even tolerate a 9 hour flight from east coast of the US to Europe. So, idk how I'm gonna tolerate a 20+ hour flight. 

I'm hoping that I can fly in December. I'm officially done with all school work by the 2nd week of December. So technically I might be spending Christmas in Southeast Asia. 

I do have a hotel reservation in Bangkok but I can easily cancel it, even if I won't get a refund, it wasn't a lot of money. Haven't booked any plane tickets yet. 

I'm going to be flying out of JFK here in NYC. Idk which route I'll go. I can either fly through the pacific ocean with a layover in Seoul, or fly with a layover in either Switzerland or Doha.

So for my itinerary: 

Get a sak yant tattoo from an arjan 

Day trip to Ayuttaya 

Elephant sanctuary in Chiang Mai 

White, Black &amp; Blue temples in Chiang Rai

Flight from Bangkok to Cambodia - I'm only interested in Angkor Wat 

Day or 2 in Phuket

This will probably be 3 ish weeks from the end of May to the middle of June but I’m flexible. It’s a good mix of Urban/Hiking/Beach as well as I like all 3 when I travel.

Fly into Munich - 1-2 nights Explore/Nightlife

Train to Innsbruck 3-4 nights - Hiking a new trail each day/Exploring

Train to Ljubljana 2 nights - with a day trip to Lake Bled

Train to Pula 2 nights - Beach days/Exploring the city

Overnight ferry to Venice 1 night Exploring the city

Train to Milan 1 night - Exploring

Tour du Mont Blanc (France/Italy/Switzerland)- 6 nights Hiking

The places should all be pretty evenly spaced out to where ideally I can catch an early train and have the rest of the day to explore or whatever when I get there, so I don’t have to tack on extra travel days. 

If this itinerary holds I’d have another 3 days that I’m not sure what to do with yet but they might be there to help with travel, depending on your thoughts.

Given this itinerary, I still have questions.

• Is a visit to Pula worth it? This is not one of my top priorities but I want to visit if it’s not too much. 

• I’ve heard some negative things about Milan so I only gave it one night but that can change. What are your thoughts?

• Not sure which airport to fly home (Atlanta) from TMB. Even with those extra 3 days I want TMB to be the last thing I do before leaving.

• Can I get by with only English or should I learn some other languages? I’m learning some German if that helps.

rakahr11,gaib3n,Storytime! This weeks topic: Funny Intercultural Misunderstandings - Introduction,"Hello everyone! I decided to start a storytime series, with a weekly topic and of course i will start out with one of my gems i got during my travels.

Shortly, Some small key things about me: I (30m) started traveling on my own when i was 16 and since then i was on every continent of the world but africa and antarctica.   
I am missing a lot of countries though, so luckily, i haven't been ""everywhere"" yet. My longest breakless travel was for a bit more than a year exploring south, southeast asia, ozeania and Oz.  
I always travelled alone and teamed up with fellow travelers along the way.   
My luggage was never bigger than handluggage (7-9 kg) and was just a regular over the shoulder day bag. 

Feel free to ask me any questions or dm me if you like!

So here i go with this weeks story:

I was traveling in South India, Kerala at that time and met a person along the way. I met Jonathan desperately looking for a place to sleep, while i was outside having a cigarette and battling my sick stomach. We were able to convince the night guard to bring us a second matress and that Jonathan can stay in my single room.

Along the way up from Trivandrum we passed by varkala, parajakadavu and wanted to stay in Kottayam to do a back water tour and go to munnar later for some tea plantation sightseeing and cooler temperatures.

We arrived in Kottayam around 5 pm. It was january, so the sun goes down pretty early. The whole city had a very weird vipe and there were only 2 hotels, which were fully booked and basically no accomodation other than those hotels. The lonely planet was no help, and so we went asking if there is a place where we could stay the night.

After an hour or two, it was already pitch dark and we got more and more scared to walk around in the dark, we found a place that seemed to offer a bed.

I asked the guy at the frontdoor: ""are you full?"" He said: ""no! no i am not fool"". Me:""Oh great, your are not full"", He:""No, no I am full!"", Me: ""But you said your aren't full, so are you full?"", He: ""No i am no fool!""

I was pretty confused. He started to shout at me in Malayalam with some english bits and throw us on the streets. A guy appeared next to us and asked: ""Why you calling him a fool?""

I understood my mistake, or rather that i haven't pronounced the word correctly enough.

Since then, i always ask for ""room free"" rather than ""full"". haha.

Ive spent 6 months travelling Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Malaysia. 

I then took another trip to SEA to spend 3 weeks in the Philippines.

I also spent 3 weeks cycling (bike touring/living in a tent) in Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia. 

I'm trying to choose between a trip to:

Option 1: Sri Lanka

Option 2: Colombia and either Nicaragua or Peru (ill chose between either NIc or Peru if I decide option 2 is the one I want).

I'm flexible when I can travel and I'm also flexible for how long i can travel for but it'll likely be about a month.

One thing I love about travel is broadening my horizons, seeing new things, new ways of life. For that reason I was considering central/south America as I've not explored that are yet. But then one place I feel I've missed during my SEA trips is Sri Lanka. 

I'll describe my interests below to help choose:

I like real true adventures. I like the outdoors and really like a proper exploration. I'm very fit and healthy and I like challenges too (hence the 3 week cycle ride consisting of 120km rides every day). I like getting out into nature and don't mind roughing it. Especially doing all of this with good company from others. It's the sense of adrenaline I crave which helps make life long memories. I like being out of my comfort zone. All of this betters me and gives me a sense of achievement. 

Affordable when factoring everything in... flights from London, travel when I'm there etc. I travel budget.

I like to swim in natural environments (the sea of lakes) when it's safe to do so (I won't get eaten by a crocodile or shark!). This doesn't mean I need to swim for all of my trip but it's nice to do at least a few times.

I'm a 25 year old single male so I would like to meet new people especially other solo travellers (and maybe a solo female traveller). I love a good social hostel. 

I appreciate both options I listed are hot countries but I'd enjoy it if I wasn't sweating every minute of my trip!",solotravel,1588269036
ripponguy,gb0l50,"How much money will I need to travel through Europe, Africa and the Middle East for 5 months next year?","
*this is a very long post so sorry for the length of it!

So I’m planning a big trip for summer 2021. I was thinking June - October. I am a solo traveller, a 24 year old guy who is not extravagant. It will essentially be a somewhat comfortable backpacking trip. 

So far I have accumulated about $11,000 CAD (Canadian currency) in my savings account for this trip. I was originally planning to go to Europe for a month or so in July/Aug. but as this pandemic has unfolded it is obviously likely not possible at all to travel this summer or anytime soon... so this is giving me more time to save. I am still working so that is good, and I make pretty okay money. I’m able to put away around $500 each paycheck that I get. Sometimes a bit more, sometimes a little bit less. I will have one more full year to save now, and expect that I can save around an additional $12,000-$14,000 CAD between now and next May/June, just depending on how frugal/money smart I am going to be. At the very minimum I can save another 8,000-10,000 CAD for sure. 

Anyways, my question is - probably for those who have spent a lot of extended periods of time abroad... how much money will I really need? I have no purchased flights, accommodation or anything as of yet. Just saving. So this expected 20-24k CAD will be for everything. Spending money? 

I am planning on going for 5 months, like I said, to Europe and Middle East/Africa. Some of the countries I plan to hit are very expensive, and some are much cheaper. I plan to go to Iceland, Scotland, Ireland, England, France, Italy, Spain, Croatia, Germany, Austria, Poland, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Czechia, Turkey, Israel, Jordan (Petra), Egypt (if safe), Zimbabwe (guided tour of Victoria falls and such), and Morocco. 

As you can see this is a very ambitious and lengthy/ packed trip. It’s going to expensive. And basically I just want to know if you all think I’m being realistic with the amount of money I plan to have saved and the number of countries I plan to visit. Am I being realistic or naive? It will be for 5 months as I really don’t want to rush my way through all the countries and I really wanna explore and take it all in. Some places I prefer to spend a much longer time in (I plan to stay in London for 20-25 Days, Ireland-10 days) and some I want to only spend 2/3 or 4 days in (Austria, Czechia, Hungary etc) I realize that some of the more expensive western countries are the ones I want to spend longer in... and this could be problematic. I also will be staying in hostels, NOT hotels, and I will be able to stay for free with a friend for a big portion of my time in England. I am not a shopper at all, as in clothing or commodities, so I will be spending very little on merchandise or goods, if anything at all. But I do like to go out a lot and party / explore nightlife. Food is going to be a major expense, obviously, but as I’ve travelled alone before, some days I’m really good at just getting by on a cheap sandwich and some chips and fruit and the like. I’m not going to be going out for many extravagant meals, but I will be wanting to experience the odd upper-tier cuisine restaurants and try out some good food. As for other expenses - I hope to go on a few guided tours. And train mostly between the countries where I can. So I’m expecting some kind of rail pass might be accessible to me. I’m also not forgetting about travel health insurance and expenses like this.

So basically, can some one who has done what I am planning enlighten me and give me any advice, tips, insight and info on my plans? Should I be condensing my trip? Is it do-able? Am I crazy? If the money is not enough, how much *would* I need to make this trip a reality? I think 20k - 24k is a lot of money... but I would probably even wait another additional year to save more if it weren’t do - able and make it 30? As I really want to hit all these places on my list, and truly embark on the trip of a lifetime. So please any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!",solotravel,1588269132

TheFoolsWhoDream,gb6so8,Traveling and Tourism / Vacation are not the same,"So I posted this on r/unpopularopinions and a lot of people seemed to disagree with me and obviously I'm sure everyone on here will agree, but I just wanted to make sure what I'm saying makes sense. 

This is probably going to sound very pretentious, but I know and see so many people who claim to love traveling, but they always stay in the most expensive hotels, eat at the most expensive restaurants, and don't actually immerse themselves in the culture of wherever they are and it makes me so angry. These people don't like traveling, they like going on vacation. Usually I see this from rich / wealthy people and it's very common among social media influencers. I don't want to police what anyone does and take away from what people enjoy doing, but travel is all about really immersing yourself in the culture, learning some of the local language, meeting local people, and trying new experiences. It's staying in a hostel for $20 a night with people from all over the world, renting an apartment on AirBnb from a local couple, and getting lost wandering the streets. It's coming away having learned more about the history and people of where you are and coming away with a new perspective on the world. I don't understand how staying in a copy and paste hotel that costs $1,000 a night equates to a new experience, whereas if you stay in someone's apartment and get to know a little bit about what it's like to truly live where you are. As someone who doesn't have the money to travel freely, but really enjoys learning languages and exploring new places, it is so infuriating to see rich people waste their time ""traveling"" all over the world when the things they're doing could be done in any city in the world and claiming. I don't know if this is actually unpopular or not, but I thought I'd share. Traveling and going on vacation are not the same.

I think a lot of people took this is me saying that traveling isn't going to a new place and they didn't understand that I actually just meant that the word ""travel"" means a whole lot more to a whole lot of people and not all travel is the same.",solotravel,1588288905

does anybody have anything they wished they had done or had done better in a solo travel trip?

Im not the most outgoing person but I did meet a few people. I do wish I had done a better effort in meeting people and going out more in the nighttime. I was raised to always watch your back and avoid putting yourself in dangerous situations so I think that was part of the reason I didnt go out as much.

The second was to San Diego, and I dont know if it should be considered a solo trip because I went for a friend's wedding but I went for a week and was solo for most of it, so to me its a solo trip. I did a better job of meeting people and going out but I still feel like I could've done a better job at going out and meeting people.

ilovejoe143,frdebb,Need a new trip inspiration for late this year after I have decided to scratch my idea of a trip for this year. Thanks COVID-19...,"Hi all, I was originally planning a trip for this year to go to Poland, Vienna, and Prague. I didn’t have a specific date in mind but I was thinking late spring/ early summer or early fall. I have unfortunately come to terms with the fact that I probably will not be able to do this trip. It is, in fact, due to the COVID 19. To explain a little further, I am living in the US currently (green card) and have a Canadian passport. My passport is expiring in August and I have been meaning to renew it very soon. I was planning on getting my passport photos done a few weeks ago but COVID 19 has shut everything down. Canadian passport photo requirements are very strict so I cannot just go to a drug store, which are open, and get my photo taken, I have to go to an actual photographer, which are all closed. Years ago, I did get my renewal sent back with a drugstore photo so they do not mess around. I do not want to risk getting my renewal form sent back again.

So this really limits what I can do. I really have only a few options: 

1) attempt to renew my passport as quickly as possibly once things start to get better and get to a photographer. I am estimating I can get to a photographer in a early summer, mid summer if things are not good. This would mean a trip with little planning after I get my passport, around late summer, early fall I hope. I am a big planner with trips, so this trip would have to stay on the simpler side, otherwise I will get anxious lol

2) stay domestically. This isn’t ideal as I have seen a lot of the US, and I am not very intrigued by many places in the US to travel to solo. 

3) go somewhere in the winter. I am thinking by winter time, the COVID-19 issue will be much more under control and travel should be good. I should also have my passport by then. Thinking this could be a ski trip as I am an avid skier

Anyone have any ideas that would fit in one of the above categories? The trip would be max about 12 days including travel. Budget is not too much of an issue, but I do like to travel a bit more on the budget side. 

Places I have been: London, Paris, Amsterdam, Budapest, Zurich, Spain, Brussels, Canada, and many places in the US (too many to list).

Guess what! We noticed that they are used to traveling with a theme. So we had decided to have something like a goal for our journey.

Do you want to know what our theme was? We decided to push the boundaries of possibility, to step out of our comfort zones and fight against our weaknesses. 
It was the first time when we tried bungee jumping and skydiving. We had no idea how to keep our memories and how to take a photo of this. How to catch great memories without a photograph with us. I am a developer so we developed an application that helps us to solve the problem. Here is the simple movie to show how the app works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBccSieCw7s .

SoloTravelerWorld,frsood,Travel and COVID-19: A Missive from Morocco from SoloTravelerWorld.com,"*I'm writing about my experience of travel and COVID-19 over the last three days of my trip to Morocco, from the point of hearing that “we should leave now” to actually getting onto my flight home.* 

Though I am currently in Morocco with a bit of uncertainty about flights home, the pain I feel during this crisis is for the hotel workers, the vendors in the Medina, the tour guides and coach drivers, the restaurant workers and all who are being affected by the lack of tourists.

For everyone in tourism, from the women weaving carpets in the Atlas Mountains (whose carpets won't sell this year, leaving a surplus in the market and making income next year precarious as well), to the employees of the tour companies with whom you book your trips, my heart aches.

Many of us will be affected financially due to the virus, but those working in tourism will feel it first. And, while many in North America and Europe have some sort of financial cushion, savings or access to loans from family, financial institutions or potentially government, that will not be the case for many workers in Morocco and elsewhere, whose very survival depends on tourists.

To give you a sense of the situation, in this hotel of 226 rooms, the 15 in our group represents more than half of the people staying in the hotel.

It's difficult to reconcile what we see in the markets of Marrakesh with what we see and hear from home. 

Images on the news and social media don't connect with my experience here, where the markets are stocked and ready for an influx of tourists. From trinkets to, yes, toilet paper, the shelves of shops in the Medina are full. Though yesterday, at the Carrefour, it was clear that panic-buying has begun to happen here as well.

To see reports of travel and COVID-19 on the news, looking at the pandemic from a global scale, with panic buying and images of thousands of passengers in airports trying to get home, it can look quite terrible. From my individual experience, it is not so, at least not so far.

## How to Get Home Was the Big Question

Most of the time spent getting home has been waiting to find out how we'll get home. Fortunately, Marco and the staff at Just You were taking care of this.

The confusion started on Saturday. Our original flights were to leave Tuesday but there were reports that the Moroccan government would be closing their airspace by Monday night. The scramble began. We basically kept our bags packed and ready to go on a moment's notice from then on.

Sunday, we thought we could be going. Early morning we found that we weren't and were able to squeeze in one more excursion. We went to Essaouira, a lovely seaside town a few hours from Marrakesh. We were all happy to be going somewhere to get our minds off the turmoil and enjoy travel. I actually bought a painting.

Monday morning we went to breakfast looking for information as to whether we'd get out that afternoon or not. It took until noon to find out that it wasn't possible but, through some magic, Morocco agreed to keep planes flying on the 17th and we would leave the next day on our originally scheduled flights.

However, not everyone was flying with Just You. Two women had made their own flight arrangements and had to confirm whether theirs were still going. Fortunately, they had a family member at home who was their travel agent. All went well for them.

Another woman had had plans to move on to Portugal after our trip. As the Canadian government's advice changed day by day, her plans changed as well. Just You was very helpful in finding her a route home. Though we left Marrakesh on different planes, we both had a transfer and one night stay at London Gatwick. I already had a room booked so I offered to share.

Yes, we were somewhat stuck the last few days of the trip, with lots of uncertainty, but we were in a nice hotel. Efforts were being made to ensure that we could leave and get home.

Once at the airport, we met many people whose return flights were much later than the 17th. For them, standby was the only solution.

## Travel and COVID-19: At the Airport

Tuesday morning, I awoke to an email from my husband and yet another article saying that Morocco was closing air travel to and from the UK at 23:59 that night. My faith lay with the embassies. I was sure they would have negotiated a means for repatriating their citizens. After all, what does Morocco want with us?

We left for the airport at 9:00 am for a 2:30 pm flight. We didn't know what we would be in for and all agreed, better to sit there and have time to deal with whatever was ahead of us than stay too long at the hotel.

When we arrived, the confusion made it difficult to determine what line to get in. There was no one to ask. I went to the front of the line and the men there had been waiting since 6:30 am. They didn't have tickets! I asked others as I walked back to my group and discovered some had tickets and some were there on a wish and a prayer. We waited there two hours when, finally, a representative came to declare the line we were in to be for standby travelers and another for those with confirmed tickets. We were in the wrong line. Ah well, there was a great shuffle and all got sorted.

While in line I met two women whose tour was cut short by about eight days. On their way to the Atlas Mountains they turned back and were put up for a night in Marrakesh. The next day they were left to sort their way home to New Zealand on their own despite having booked their flights through a different tour company. Their confirmed tickets were not for another week and, of course, they had to get out much sooner than that. I have to say, hearing this story confirmed that the care taken of us by Just You was really exceptional.

## We're On Board the Aircraft

Once through check-in, security, and additional security at the gate, we boarded the aircraft only to wait some more. For some reason, we were not getting permission to take off despite there being very few planes at the airport.

An hour and a quarter in, they announced that they would begin to serve refreshments. But, as we were in Morocco, there would be no alcoholic drinks. You can imagine the sighs and laughs at this announcement. People were happy, even a little giddy, as we seemed to be on our way. These little inconveniences were more a source of humor than anything.

Two and a half hours after our scheduled departure, we got on our way. To great applause we landed at Gatwick another three hours later. Collecting our bags was easy as there was only one conveyor operating in the baggage claim area.

I expect that tomorrow's flight home via Air Transat will be easy with a fairly empty terminal but I'll get there early just in case. If anything special happens, I'll add it to this post.

I will be very glad to be home!

But then, there's two weeks of self-isolation. Ah well, I can use the time to write and dream of future travel.

I'd like to thank [Just You](https://justyou.com/) for sponsoring this trip to Morocco. Please be assured the opinions are all my own.

## An Update from Home

Leg two of my trip home was from London Gatwick Airport to Toronto. I flew Air Transat, an airline that is often less expensive and one that I like for a number of reasons.

We boarded and on each seat was a plastic bag holding a sandwich, small Pringles, bottle of water and a sweet for dessert. The senior flight attendant came on the speaker to announce that this was a repatriation flight and would not, therefore have regular service. As she went on her voice cracked, I teared up and when I looked at the two women beside I saw that they had as well.

Upon arrival there were claps and cheers.

Home is an emotion as much as it is a place.

2. If i would like to hike through all these parks what would be the best way to organize it?

3. I have never done a ”serious” big hike before, what would be your best tips?

elevenkgod,fscwfi,Traveling on a tight budget leds to a more fun/ adventourus/ authentic experience overall vs not traveling on a budget,"I know there are exceptions and you can't fully generalize and it really depends on the person you are (what you like, want, need etc) and country. 

But for me the best stories and experiences I had where when I really had to take care of my budget and tried to spend as less I possibly could.

Examples: 
You can't afford or don't want to pay for a certain tour so you try to get there yourself and you have to get in touch with locals to ask. 
You don't want to pay to get from A to B for a tourist bus/ flight so you have to hitchhike/ take 5 different local busses/ ferrys/ fisher boats/ etc.
You can't afford or don't want to pay for normal accomodation, so you couch surf or ask locals for cheap ""fucked up"" hotels at non touristy spots you wouldn't have seen otherwise etc.
There are many more examples! 

In my opinion It really depends on you but if you want an authentic/ adventourus travelexperience you should try to do everything you can and want on a budget. Cause then you have to interact more with locals and strangers (hitchhike/ couch surf/ asking people on the streets) 
I know it sounds cliché but the best things that happened to me where things I couldn't buy (even If I wanted to), like getting invited by locals for dinner/ fiestas/ overnight stay/ fishing trips etc. 

Also for me it feels different if I do a tour X with an agency, pay for it and get everything instantly or if I try to do the same tour X by myself or friend or with a help of a local guide. Like in general just the feeling of authenticity when you walk and explore something on your own VS doing the same thing but having to pay for it (it almost feels like that when money is involved it can destroy the FEELING of authenticity or whatever word I'm searching for right now)
+ being on a budget forces you to be creative which is fun and you might feel proud of yourself to master a certain ""challenge"". 
+ you learn a lot more about a culture cause you are literally living it when you use the same transport, sleep in their houses, eat the same food do the same stuff etc. 

Also my experience (attention: very subjective opinion): Most of the time, when I choose to sleep in hostels, I compare the hostels on different aspects first but one of the most important aspects to me is the price but it's not just the price itself! I found most of the time people in cheaper hostels are more likely to be longtime solotraveler like me and are often more fun and social compared to people staying in fancy hostels. Of course they can be fun and they def are but the interests are more often different then mine (example drinking/ partying) and in my experience they were less ""crazy and unique personalities"" (which I personally love to meet) or open to new uncommon experiences. A reason for that could be that people in the more expensive accommodations have more money are more likely on vacation etc.

PS: I had totally different trips and different experiences. With and without a lot of money. And I don't have to be that short on a budget but for me it's just more fun and interesting (and of course, the cheaper, the more/ longer trips I can do). But still I prefer my trips where I tried to be on a budget.",solotravel,1585661282
indthwy,fsece6,Is India the most disliked country by solo travelers in general?,"Because I see way way more complaints about India being more hassle-y, dangerous, tourist-unfriendly than just about any other country in the world.

rakuu,fsiqn5,"Curious, any solo travelers here with a trust fund, Swiss bank account, or other ways family pay for your travels?","I see this so often among young people (18-23) and ""digital nomads"" in the hostel scene.  I've run into conversations with young people talking to each other about their family's yachts, going on safaris, staying at fancy expensive island resorts, having different family houses, paying with their family's credit cards, or calling up their family for another bank transfer.

They almost always hush or change the conversation when I get close or say hi.  It just really seems like they only talk about it amongst themselves.  I'm guessing it's rich people culture, where they don't talk about it with people who don't have money.

This really fascinated me and I started steering convos (naturally and friendly!) into leading questions.  Have you been on a yacht, been to Africa, favorite beach, what kind of high school did you go to?  Etc.  With some followups of course.  Almost always with younger people I'd find out they went to prep/boarding schools, went to resorts growing up with their families, etc.

Staying in hostels seems like a weird rite of passage for young rich people, like living in messy sororities or frats, sharing tiny apartments in Brooklyn, etc.  Then once they get to their mid-20's I never see them anymore and it's all teachers on break, older people who never got to travel before, people taking a trip of a lifetime, etc.  I'm guessing the young people from loaded families move up to staying in boutique hotels and going to fancy/Michelin restaurants once they get a little older.

Is this on point?  It seems like a big thing that just isn't talked about, especially in European/Western culture.  Anyone want to share experiences about this?",solotravel,1585680669
Blackgirlwanders,fsmiec,Roadtrip through the US vs backpacking through South America? (Solo Black female),"Hey everyone! 

This trip obviously wont happen anytime soon, but it will require some planning so hence me asking now. I will be studying abroad in California from january 2021 for one semester. The plan was always to knock of usa roadtrip from my bucketlist. Im unsure if going on a roadtrip is the best thing to do solo? A backpacker trip through South America sounds more “solo-friendly” to me. Being on the road for that long seems like it could be a bit lonely? Unless I slept at hostels along the way I guess. 

Would it be safe to drive alone in the US as a Black woman? Im 5’2” and 114 lbs... 

It would be cheaper too to just go to South America and since its cheap to travel to Colombia from California, it could be a fun option. Then I could always do the US thing another time when I have someone I could bring along. But on the other hand, its really high on my bucketlist so it would be amazing to do.

What would you choose? Oh another issue is my lack of a drivers license. I could get it before I travel obviously, but alternatively I could take a bus through the country.

jmil077,fsqj8u,Year Long Trip Budget Advice,"Budget For Long Term Travel Advice

Me and a friend plan (go away COVID-19) on embarking on a year around the world trip starting in August of this year. We are taking a year off of college and work to travel. We have an idea of where we want to go and the budget we would like to spend, but would like to get some advice from those of you who have more experience with trips of this nature. We are mainly going to be playing it by ear as to where we are going, but have some places/things that we do not want to miss. As for budget, I am thinking $18,000 USD excluding air travel, travel insurance, and vaccinations (I will be able to use a buddy pass to and fro the US which will cost about $300 plus I have credit card miles for the flights in between). Places that we plan on seeing:

\*European countries are just the main cities ie: France (Paris) or Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) unless otherwise noted. We do not plan on exploring smaller towns in Europe to help save on our budget

Portugal, Spain, France, Switzerland (Swiss Alps), Netherlands, Norway (To see the Fjords, we will mainly be camping), Austria, Greece (Athens and Santorini), Turkey, Egypt, Israel, India, Nepal, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Philippines, Japan, Australia. 

The European part of the trip will be about 3 months and then 9 months from Egypt until the end.

We will probably stop at some other countries in between if it is cheap to do so such as one or two eastern European countries. Our main accommodation will be hostels or airbnbs that are cheap to split between us in SEA. We will probably visit a fair amount of museums and plan on doing a lot of nature based experiences, our most costly being scuba diving in the great barrier reef, skydiving in Australia, and possibly an extended trek in the Himalayas (not climbing just multi day hikes). We enjoy partying, and will probably drink 2-3 times a week.

We are interested in volunteering with something like WWOOF. I am thinking that doing so for a month or so would definitely help with our budget and is something we would like to do anyways. Our main concerns are if we would have a couple free days a week to be able to explore where we decide to do it at. If anyone has experience with WWOOF or another organization tips would be greatly appreciated.

I'm a 20M from the UK and have been traveling since January, I'm with my GF who is from the United States. We entered Montenegro around 2 weeks ago by bus just as the Serbian border closed behind us. We thought we could wait out the virus because at the time Montenegro was the only country in Europe to not have any cases but obviously that changed. After a few days in Budva the hostel manager told us we had to leave as the hostel was closing and we thought that was going to be the same for all hostels in the country. We booked flights to London with a stop over in Serbia, unfortunately we couldn't board that flight as Serbia's borders had closed and foreigners could not enter. We thought we were fucked but found out there was a hostel in Kotor which is where we've been for the past 2 weeks, and there are a few other guys here aswell some of which are trying to return home. 

Now the dilemma: do I push my luck and stay here for the foreseeable future to see if things to improve which may takes months or do I attempt to contact and embassy or something and return home.

The issues are that if me and the GF leave there's a high chance she won't be able to stay in the UK and would have to go back to the US (which I believe is a massive pain in the ass to return to and Corona is massive over there) which would result in us separating for a very long time. And then I'd be back home bored and not doing much and obviously the same for her. At least here at the hostel there are some others and we can do stuff as a group even if it's play board games and such but who knows how long they are gonna stay here.

loosebumhole,ft98q9,Need advice for my first solo travel,"Hi everyone! My 18th birthday is coming right up, and i recently finished school in my home country of the Netherlands, and my plan was to take a gap year and travel for 6 months around Southeast-Asia. I was planning to visit Myanmar, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan and The Phillipines. I have around €7000 saved which is around $7500. I'm planning to save up to around $8500, and budget a bit. I am quite the inexperienced solo traveler though. Even though I have visited 15 different countries, I have never been outside of the Netherlands without my parents, so I'm still trying to figure everything out, and I was hoping you would be able to answer a couple of questions or give me some advice :)

My questions are:
- Should I try carry-on-only? It will save a lot of money but I might bite off more than I can chew if I try it.
- Is $7500 enough money? If not, is $8500 enough? What would you recommend?
- Are there any places I should absolutely visit/avoid?
- What do you think about airlines during this corona virus? Do you think the corona virus travel ban will be gone around octobre? Do you think the tickets will be more expensive or cheaper than usual? When should I book my flights?

Sorry for any weird spelling, I have a new phone and my auto-correct really wants me to speak Dutch.

Thanks in advance

latinuh96,f9x367,Tips for first trip without family/possible solo trip,"Hi everyone 

I (23F) am a student and full time worker. Recently I decided that I want to get the most out of my young life and travel- whether or not someone comes along because life is too damn short. Anyways, I come from an extremely protective household and, because I live with my mom, she reminds me how anxious or fearful she is when it comes to me traveling alone for the first time. 

With that in mind I am looking at some possible group traveling tours or going on a trip to Portland or Seattle alone for a few days (I live in the SF Bay Area) since it isn't too far in comparison to other places. 

As a woman in her 20's-what are some tips for planning a trip? Since I go to Oakland and the city a lot I am usually on my toes. I don't party with people I don't know (Which worries me about going to bars in new cities alone!), I keep important belongings on my person, I had mace which got thrown out by a bouncer but are there other things I can use when travelling for a form of protection?

Any other solo travelers recommend places to go to? Group travel places I might be better of using? Thanks!",solotravel,1582739405

I have USD 3000 to spend, with 968 already committed to plane tickets, so really I have 2032 dollars to spend on 8 net days. 

My idea was visiting as many landmarks in Riviera Maya (Chichen Itzá, Coba, Ek Balam, Tulum's ruins, some cenotes, Sian Ka'an) and as many beaches (Punta Maroma, Paraiso Beach, Santa Fe Beach, Holbox, Isla Mujeres' North Beach) as possible. However, I'm very concerned about safety and in general I avoid ""social"" places like hostels, so I'd like to stay in hotels that offer me some privacy, comfort and safety.

I had split my trip like this

|Place|Day|Activity|
|---|---|---|
|Cancún|1|Arrival|
|Playa del Carmen (Iberostar Quetzal) | 1 | Arrival/Relax Playacar beach|
||2|Tour Chichen-Itza/Ek Balam|
||3|Tour Xel-ha|
||4|Punta Maroma/relax|
|Tulum (Azura Hotel)|5|Arrival|
||6|Tulum ruins/Playa Paraiso|
||7|Coba/Playa Santa Fe|
|Isla Mujeres (Izla Hotel)|8|Arrival|
||9|North Beach / South Beach / tour island|
|Cancun|10|Depart|

However, due to my budget, I'm considering cutting a day from the all-inclusive in Playa del Carmen and spend a day in Holbox the day I arrive. There isn't much to do there other than staying in the beach, so I don't think I should spend more than a day there?

What do you think? Should I cut some of these activities, too? Should I avoid some of these hotels, stick to beach-side resorts if I'm too worried about safety? And will all the traveling up and down Yucatan take a toll instead of helping me relax?

I have previously been to Portugal, Morocco, England / Wales, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden! So it would be great if I could have suggestions for other countries!

After some [nice information was shared with my last time I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/f9zp6w/checked_bag_vs_carry_on_8_days_in_stockholm/), I realized that maybe my perspective on my upcoming trip is a bit skewed. I was planning on bringing 1000-1200 with me to stockholm (Ive read that Stockholm/Sweden is a mainly cashless society so probably wont bring any Euros/USD with me and just withdraw there?). 

I will be visiting an event at the Ericsson Globe and will be spending 1/2 of the trip in/around the globe. The other portion I will be spending around Stockholm (Though open for day trips to nearby cities/countries if possible). I would love to visit the museums, Royal palace and other sights. I have read that Stockholm is an expensive place to visit for various reasons however I do live just outside of Boston and our CoL is quite high and some of the prices I see posted from Stockholm are similar to what I would pay or is less than what it is in Boston.

If anyone here has visited Stockholm or has any experience with pricing for a week in Stockholm I would love to hear your stories and advice.

1. Should I do a different country/backpacking route and wait till I have more saved up to do this Australia trip?
2. If going through with this, what is a good plan as far as a route and how long to stay in each place?

For me, when I'm planning a trip I normally go on G-Adventures and see what routes they have for their tours in that country or even the region. I'm not one to ever go on the tour, but it gives a really idea of sense of direction and any places I might be missing.

WikiTravel/Voyage for reading up on destinations.

I \*always\* scout my hostels on HostelWorld simply for the ""atmosphere"" indicator. No one else has this, and the HW rating is the best IMO. Then I will book on Agoda. For some reason - in SE Asia at least - the Agoda price is normally £2 or £3 cheaper than what you'll see on HW or Booking... and even be offered on the desk in person! I've yet to figure why.

Of late one thing I do when arriving to a country to see if someone has blogged an ""arriving to X airport"" thing on YouTube. Take Bangkok, a few people have uploaded videos showing the best places to exchange money, where you go to get the train, and I feel like it just really helps walking out of Customs and being somewhat familiar with what it all looks like and the general direction you're heading.

CamboMakgeolliMan,faqn6h,"Not my words, but a very accurate assessment of Corona-Virus.","Don't Mention the C-word in the Travel Industry

(A short piece to share with colleagues in the Travel Industry)

Coronavirus, or the exotically named Covid-19, is the new C-word, at least in the world of travel and tourism. Media and social media hype are combining to create a crisis in the industry that will have repercussions long after the immediate hysteria subsides. 
 
The effects are about so much more than tourism statistics, they are about real people, real lives, real jobs and real struggles. Every cancelled trip adds up to a climate of fear and uncertainty within the travel industry and companies begin to tighten the purse-strings. It has an impact all the way down the food chain as overseas tour operators cancel holidays, airlines ground flights and local DMCs cancel itineraries. This in turn means hotel cancellations, tour guide cancellations, vehicle cancellations, restaurant cancellations, excursion cancellations and so it goes on. This can have a negative impact on morale in a brittle industry in a less-developed country where the margins between progress and poverty are wafer thin. It can also have a disastrous impact on income for those many millions of individuals involved in making a living in this industry.

Let's pause and reflect for a moment on what has happened to date, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics. Around 80,000 people have been infected globally to date, although the numbers are still spiking in some countries, and about 2700 people have died. This is undoubtedly a terrible hardship to endure for those most immediately affected, but it might be useful to put this in the perspective of some other statistics:
 
•    250,000 to 500,000 flu deaths occur annually according to older WHO statistics, some put the numbers at closer to 290,000-650,000 annually

•    250,000 people have been hospitalised in the USA with flu this winter alone (and it's not over) with about 14,000 deaths

•    1,350,000 traffic-accident related deaths occur worldwide per year according to the WHO

•    228 million cases of malaria were diagnosed in 2018, of which 405,000 proved fatal, according to the WHO

•    464,000 murders took place worldwide in 2017

This information is not shared to appear fatalistic or pessimistic, but to help rediscover our sense of perspective in these dark times. Flu happens every year in every corner of the world and all-too tragically kills an awful lot of people, but we still go about our daily lives and continue to travel the world. Traffic accidents are a clear and present danger to our lives, but we still need to drive from A to B as part of our daily lives. Malaria has been a constant in many parts of the world for too many years to remember, but locals are forced to live with its threat (despite the availability of affordable treatments) and many visitors continue to travel to countries where malaria exists. Murders are a horrible reality in almost every country of the world, often quite random in nature, and the total number is beyond comprehension. However, once again, we continue to explore and experience other cultures and other places. 

So let us put the C-word in its context among a myriad of other problems that face many people in many parts of the world as they go about their daily lives. Let's not make the small medical crisis of a new flu strain become a socio-economic and political crisis that tips the world into a global recession and devastates not just the tourism industry, but every other industry on this planet. The human cost will be too great to bear and undo a generation of progress in many parts of the developing world.",solotravel,1582872265

I have depression as well (goes hand-in-hand with OCD), so as you can imagine I’m a ball of anxiety, dread, and self-doubt. I also love to solo travel. It has been difficult (and so ridiculous it borders on amusing at times), so I wanted to share some of my experiences with the /OCD, /depression, and /solotravel communities to a) share some funny stories, and b) to show that it’s possible to still \~do\~ things even if you’re mentally ill. So, read on and learn some of the dos-and-donts of travelling with mental illness!

&amp;#x200B;

INCIDENT NUMBER 1: RABIES SCARE (FIRST SEQUENCE)

When I was in Petra, a kitten jumped on my lap and I almost-maybe-possibly-can’t-be-sure think I felt his claws on my leg through my pants. Didn’t think anything of it until a week later when I was in Turkey and decided that I had definitely contracted rabies and I was stupid for not realising this sooner. Proceeded to have a slight breakdown, ask everyone in my dorm if they thought I should go to the hospital (“no? it didn’t break skin?”), post on reddit, cry, and google which hospital I should go to the next day. Went to hospital no. 1, couldn’t find anyone at reception to help me. Tried to catch a taxi to hospital no. 2, couldn’t find one. Went back to my hotel and called my parents so they could reassure me that, no, I didn’t have rabies and no, I didn’t need to go to the hospital. Still couldn’t deal so I messaged my nurse friend to ask her if I was being stupid. Her response? “Yes, you’re being stupid.” Decided I was okay and tried to have a good time. 

&amp;#x200B;

INCIDENT NUMBER 2: RABIES SCARE (SECOND SEQUENCE)

Are you sensing a theme here? My OCD has always been very health-focused, so the fixation on rabies doesn’t surprise me. I had (mostly) put the first rabies incident out of my mind. About three weeks after my initial freak-out, I was in Kotor and having a great time playing bullshit in the hostel common-room. The hostel was in the old town, so the common room was separate from the hostel and opened out onto the street. There were a few cats hanging around but I didn’t want a repeat of last time so I (tried) to be careful. However, as I was soon to learn, cats like me – a funny-looking ginger dude decided to make a beeline towards me, weave through 5 other people and JUMP STRAIGHT INTO MY LAP. I humoured him a little but when he started doing that THING they do with their claws on my leg I decided enough was enough and he had to go (because I reeeeealllllyyyyy didn’t want another rabies “scare”). Ginger kitty didn’t like me trying to move him though, and in protest he. grabbed. my. thumb. with. his. teeth. Understandably I freaked the fuck out, couldn’t believe this was happening AGAIN, asked why the universe hated me, and packed my shit up so I could go to Tirana in the morning to get to a decently-sized hospital. 

&amp;#x200B;

After contemplating on wtf was wrong with my life on the bus trip, I got to the hostel, binge-ate, and slept in preparation for explaining why I thought I had rabies even though I didn’t actually have a bite wound (that’s right! He didn’t actually bite me! He didn’t break skin! I didn’t even bother asking my hostel-mates for reassurance this time though, I had already decided I was dying). During this time I got my mum to talk to my GP back home to ask if I had had the full-course of the rabies vaccine, or just the partial course. After hearing what had happened my doctor, who is one of the most precautious people I have met, told my mum I had nothing to worry about and I was fine. Still went to the hospital though. There were like 6 doctors and nurses in the room looking at my thumb and trying to find the bite mark. Turning my hand over, confused. Getting a flashlight to see where on my hand this cat had bitten me. They told me I was fine (of course I was!) so I paid the 4298 LEK and left.

&amp;#x200B;

MISCELLANEOUS BECAUSE THIS IS WAY TOO LONG:

* Pulled my back out, got a Thai massage, felt worse the day after and decided I had irrevocable damaged my spine and I would be in pain for the rest of my life (spoiler: My back pain was cured the next day).
* Met the coolest dudes in Prishtina, hung out with them for a few days, and then got super-duper depressed when they left bc apparently I am not a normal human capable of processing emotions.
* Got food poisoning in Skopje and was sick for 2 weeks and genuinely thought I would never be able to enjoy food again (which was a horrifying thought for me because I’m a fat bitch and love food). 
* AND MOST IMPORTANTLY:

Had bouts of depression throughout my trip.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like this is really important to talk about from both a mental illness and solo-travel standpoint. I’ve seen a lot of posts on /solotravel asking if traveling will cure or help with depression. While I do think that traveling can have a huge impact on how you view the world and in turn how you view yourself in the world, packing up and changing your location will not automatically make you feel better. There were times when I stayed in bed for most of the day. There were times when I wasn’t necessarily enjoying myself. There were times where I was physically and emotionally drained and all I wanted to do was make it back to my hostel. Basically, there were times when I felt like I did at home when I was having a depressive episode. “Wherever you go, there you are.”

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, what I’m saying is that traveling won’t cure your mental illness. What I am NOT saying, however, is that you shouldn’t travel just because you’re mentally ill. If you want to, and you’re well enough, you should! I really do think that meeting new people and seeing new places helped me grow and understand new things about myself and all that clichéd stuff. Go into travel with the understanding that you’re not going to magically feel better, and understand that there might be times when your illness flares up and you feel like shit. That mentality is far healthier than one which treats the experience as a cure. 

&amp;#x200B;

At one point I was walking back from the shop at about 9pm and turned into my street of my guesthouse and 2 young men approached me in a bike and tried to start asking me questions which turned to ""you like massage?"" I'm 99% sure they were considering sexually assaulting me.
I'm not even including the leering by men everywhere since I'm used to that and can ignore it. 

I live in Australia so I am more than familiar with the attitudes from South East Asian countries since they are the easiest to get to and I thought of all of them Sri Lanka was the least friendly and everyone, and I mean everyone just saw me as a walking dollar sign which was the only time they where friendly. 
For comparison I felt safer in Peru,  Bali and Thailand. I could at least walk safely alone back 600m from dinner to a hotel at 8pm/9pm and the sales people where much more friendly to deal with nor was I asked once a minute to jump in a rickshaw as I'm walking down the street.",solotravel,1582908591

vecisoz,eurkqg,What places are at the top and bottom of your travel wishlist?,"I'll start...

I hope to visit every single European country. I've been to 25 so far, so I'm a little bit more than halfway there. My next stops will be Scandinavia and the Baltics. I really enjoy traveling to Europe because from Chicago it's less than a 10hr flight and flights are usually cheap. I strongly dislike hot and humid weather and wouldn't enjoy going to a place where I have to worry about getting sick on food or tainted water, so for this reason Europe is my favorite continent to visit.

Slightly lower on my bucket list is Central Asia. More modern Asian countries like Japan and Korea are also on my bucket list.

Towards the bottom of my travel list is India because it's hot, smelly, and there are too many people. Honestly, I haven't heard too many positive things about visiting here. If I went, I would probably avoid the large cities entirely and stick to the mountains and nature areas.

I'm not a beach person or a hot weather person so any of the luxury places like Maldives and Tahiti do nothing for me. Worst of all, they are outrageously expensive and aren't really made for solo traveling.

At the very bottom of my travel list are Arabian peninsula countries (and many Middle Eastern countries). There's just nothing there that interests me and some countries have antiquated views on women, gays, and alcohol use.",solotravel,1580147938

aleksbivol,euv02w,Need help: Do you think my stupid mistake will prevent me from getting VISA to US?,"First and foremost, I wanna say hello to everyone and I would be more than happy if someone could help me with my problem.

I  am a 28 year old guy from europe that has made a very very stupid   mistake that I admit and feel sorry for. I had a job interview 14th of   January 2020 and I commit my first crime in my life,.

I  was in deep mental pain from my family relationship that I do not want   to go in deeper with now, and I was feeling kinda ""lost"" and was just   started on anti-depressants 4 days prior to the crime. Anyways.... I was   on the way to the job interview 14th January 2020, and I edited my old   bus ticket with new date and time so It looked like I bought it that  day  so I could drive for free. The ticket would cost 4-5 dollars if I  had  paid it. Anyways during the trip in the bus I was approached by two  bus  workers that check for tickets and they could see it was edited  and I  started denying it at first but they kept pushing it and said if I  just  said my name and date of birth, I would be getting a fine and  thats it.

Here comes the second  crime... I gave them wrong name and birth of date  but when the police  arrived I did the same, but 5 minutes later, I  eventually said my real  name and date and got arrested.

Now I have 3 convictions against me; **Document falsification, Fraud and Identity theft.**

All  of this because I was stupid and I know its not an excuse but I was  in  very deep mental pain and sorrow that day which I also explained to   them afterwards.  
I wanna point out that this is my first offense ever... not even a parking ticket or anything.

I  am not sentenced yet, as it will take few months to go to court, but I   wonder, did this destroy my life completely? My dream since I was a   child, is to move to USA at some point or atleast visit the country   multiple times.

PLEASE, if anyone  can tell me anything, feel free to respond to this  post. Any  help/advice would be appreciated, and yes I am fully aware of  my crime  and I regret it deeply.",solotravel,1580161440
lovesprite,euv31r,I want to move out of Netherlands for a year or two(maybe longer). Need suggestions.,"Been living here for 5+ years. I dont feel so good here anymore. I want to check out a new place. I feel lonely, isolated and ""just tolerated"". Once a friend told me that people just tolerate us expats and I realized how true his description was.

**Background:**

I am a brown pakistani(people always guess that I am indian). I am also a muslim but thats not important to me. I am a software engineer and I studied and worked in the Netherlands. I am 31 years old. I may even become a citizen before leaving.

**Criteria(Arranged in order of importance)**

1.Better treatment: So my number one criteria is better treatment. Like i said earlier I sometimes feel pretty isolated/lonely. I sometimes even get very depressed. Dutch people are known to be rude(sorry) and hard to make friends with. I want a maybe more friendlier group.

2.Racism:I have noticed that as a brown pakistani I am treated worse than my white colleagues. Even my black colleagues dont get the same dirty looks that I do. I hate that and want a more friendlier place.

3.Relationships:I am 31 and want to find a life partner.I could get lucky here but I am told dutch people are really hard to even be friends with as an expat. 

4.Salaries: Should be good salaries. When I leave Netherlands I would be leaving my 30 percent ruling behind.

5.Healthcare:I am someone who gets sick from time to time with weird reasons. Sometimes its just stomach issues other times I need to get lots of tests like MRI or urine tests. I would like good healthcare that doesnt break my bank.

6.Language: This is the least important thing on the list but I got a lot of trouble trying to learn dutch. Five years of memorizing vocabulary and grammar rules and I still cant hold a conversation.(Most people here speak english). So I prefer a place with English as their first language but I wont downright disqualify other countries.

To preface this I really hate my life. I'm not so sure why but I'm just deeply unsatisfied with everything. I think I just hate who I am.
Don't get me wrong the friends I have are great but I hate myself and my situation. I feel like I'm somehow outgoing but at the same time don't feel like people take me seriously? I rarely go to parties, feel good about myself or hell even feel like I can open about myself and just feel at home with someone. (For context in currently going to a school in Canada but I just dropped my courses this semester)

When I solo traveled this went away. I was the person I wanted to be. People actually liked me. I could have an amazing day going to parties or just wandering around town doing nothing.

I feel like I'm stuck here and while I might be able to change bit by bit in scared nothing will change and I'll grow up to be a looser.

So that's it. I can't get the though of just disappearing out of my head. I'm scared if I think too long I'll get cold feet and just settle into my life staying stuck where I am.

I'm in a bit of a predicament with trip planning. I keep seeing that booking ahead saves money, which of course makes sense. However, in trying to follow this rule, I've become bottlenecked into two conclusions:

**1:** I book every hostel, flight, ferry, train, and maybe tour, and save a good chunk of change *probably*

Pros- It's all taken care of, no worries. I know what I'm doing today, tomorrow, next week.

 Cons- I can't change anything without losing money. Meet a fun group in the hostel who want to travel to Galway? Sorry, I have an 8 am train tomorrow, cant. Go to a pub? No, have to get up early to catch a ferry. 

**2:** I book the flight there, (Dublin) and the flight back home (Amsterdam). And leave everything in between to be booked and scheduled in a matter of days or weeks. 

Pros- Much more flexible, I can do what I want with much less worry about making that train on time. 

Cons- From what I've seen on this subreddit it's going to cost more, because booking travel 6 days out is murder compared to 8 weeks out. 

The reason I'm asking is I've discussed my options with a friend who has extensive travel experience and they claimed that the time sensitivity rule mostly applies to air travel, and I shouldn't be losing much money booking trains and ferries days or weeks in advance. 

I know to many of you who hold experience in this area this may seem like a stupid question, but I need some solid ground on which to lay out my plans.

jev3,euzt7s,40 Day Europe Itinerary -- first time backpacking,"&amp;#x200B;

First post in this sub!

Upon graduation in May 2020, I’m traveling around Europe (22M). I’ll likely be traveling with other friends at different segments of the trip.

I’m arriving in London on 5/25. I’m also traveling to Bangkok and will need to arrive there by 7/4. 

As such, I have roughly 40 days to travel around Europe. I can fly out of any city to Bangkok, though I expect I’ll be somewhere in the southeastern portion of Europe as I traverse the continent (maybe Greece or Turkey?)

I’m definitely a budget backpacker, and I plan to stay in hostels for the entire trip. I’ve already purchased the Eurail 2-month continuous pass and hope to travel primarily by train. Of course, I may have to take a flight or two but it’s less ideal since I bought the pass. I purchased the pass after researching the options and deciding I wanted to flexibility to move between cities on a whim. Also, I got a great deal on the youth pass during an end of year discount. 

I’d love to hear suggestions from you all on a rough itinerary of cities (though I understand that’s a super vague request). I’ve studied maps and tried to build some paths through the continent, but I’m sure this subreddit would have better advice. So far, I’ve already been to Barcelona, Vienna, Prague, and Munich on two separate trips. The rest of the continent is completely new to me, and I’d like to avoid past destinations. 

Part of me wants to “cross off” the classics (Paris, Rome, etc), but I’m also considering more Eastern Europe destinations to get off the beaten path and immerse myself deeper. Plus those places are cheaper than the tourist traps and I expect to visit Paris one day anyway. Maybe it would be best to do a bit of both.

booked the flight, 7 hours later no confirmation just said pending so I went to there support chat for ""help"" gave him my order number and he asked about if i confirmed the ""two small deposits"" in my account, I said i didnt see anything about that and he said he would contact someone, 45 mins or so passed and i messaged again, he responded again back and forth a little with broken english then said he would get back to me within the hour, I messaged an hour later saying if I could just cancel if it couldnt be confirmed, then he just said it should be confirmed now and I got an email with the e-ticket, now the ticket does have the alitalia confirmation number or whatever and also has the ticket number but not sure if im missing anything..

I figured I would call alitalia tomorrow, this all seems kinda fishy but getting the confirmation number and ticket number, confirming it on multiple sites it could be legit, wouldnt be too worried about it except for the fact I only have 24 hours (now like 15) to cancel my delta flight going to new york if this turns out to be some sort of scam, wasnt sure if anyone here has experience with Ovago or e-tickets similar..

Or if i should just cancel everything all together, most likely meaning I wont be able to go to italy, not sure, id appreciate anyones help",solotravel,1580197472
meher1999,ev2se3,Budget solo travel destinations for women?,Hey guys! So I recently went on a trip and had the opportunity to interact with a lot of backpackers and travel enthusiasts who inspired me to finally save up for my own 'Big Trip' after I graduate. I've been thinking about it for a long time but never did I actually have the time to figure it out. I feel like I'm finally at a place in my life where I can just take the leap and go for it. I'm planning on travelling solo for about 6 months to a year depending on how much I save (or whether I'd like to stay at one place for a few months to volunteer). I'd like to see some of South East Asia before hopefully heading to Europe. If someone could help me figure out an approximate cost along with some destination ideas that are female friendly (considering I'll be travelling alone) I'd be grateful!

Funkeycfunkeydo,ev4rg1,First solo trip was a success!,"First time poster, long time stalker.

So I (28M) just completed my first solo trip, a 5 day jaunt to New York. 
I made it my goal to get out and travel more this year, and not to be held back by relying on others to make plans, and to prove that I can be independent again after breaking up with my long term girlfriend last year. 
And I'm happy to report that, after some initial apprehension, I had what might be the best holiday I've ever been on! It was so liberating to plan my days however I wanted to and explore in ways I've never done so before. I made it easier on myself by having my days planned out so I was never stuck for something to do or bored, and enjoyed group activities through Airbnb experiences as well, so also got to meet some cool new people!
It was a real confidence booster being able to venture on my own and know that I can be comfortable in my own company, and also comforting knowing there's a community to take advice and tips from!

traveljg,ev8y28,Have you quit your job to solo travel?,"I’m a 30M from Canada working your typical 9-5 in a major Canadian city. I worked my ass off to get my degree in finance and it was always my dream to live and work downtown. I make pretty good money, live in a nice place and walk to work. For as long as I could remember, this is what I wanted in life and what I worked hard for. My family and the few friends I have look at me and think I have it good and would be crazy to leave, but for me security and money isn’t cutting it anymore. Slowly but surely, I’ve started to find that I don’t think this is for me, this is not how I envision my life for the next 35 years. I see people on my way to work who look miserable, almost like robots, slaving away for a corporation for 40+ years to pay off their mortgage, to look forward to a weekend until they’re 65. Even though I recently turned 30 and my 20’s are over, I still feel I’m relatively young and there’s so much life to live and I don’t want the life that everyone around me seems to have. I don’t aspire to be anyone that I work with or for. I look at those who are successful or doing things they love and think, why not me? I do have some money saved up. No mortgage, no girlfriend, no kids, no debts. Nothing really keeping me here except my job. 

I’ve done 3 trips to Europe over the last few years, with the third being the first time I went solo. This was a few months back in Oct, 2019. It was only for a few weeks and I had a general idea of my route, but the freedom I had on those two weeks was unreal. To wake up and decide what I wanted to do and where I wanted to go was bliss. Sometimes I just think about packing a backpack and taking off with a one way ticket and seeing the world, because if I don’t do it now I never will. 

Our time is too short to live an unhappy life. Losing Kobe recently made me realize that even more. I understand every situation is different and nobody can make this decision but me, however I want to gain a little bit of perspective from Reddit. My question is in the title, have you ever been unhappy at your job and decided to go on an extended solo trip? If so, how did things work out for you in the end? Did you return to regular life and how was that adjustment? Did you find your true passion and find a way to make it a living? Do you think taking an extended trip is “running away” instead of addressing the underlying issue? Any other details or information you’re willing to provide would be helpful. 

tldr; have you ever been unhappy at work, quit and solo travelled? Did it end up being the right decision for you?",solotravel,1580234470

I'm planning on solo-travelling from Canada to Switzerland for 11 days near the end of July 2020 and had a few questions about transportation/accommodations.

I'll be spending 80% of my time exploring areas abundant of nature. Current route plan: Zurich &gt; Lucerne &gt; Mt. Pilatus &gt; Interlaken &gt; Grindelwald &gt; Murren &gt; Titlis Mountain &gt; Return to Zurich

I've got the budget to rent a car, but it seems like it's almost inconvenient to drive around, figure out parking, gas price, etc. I personally love driving and like the idea that I will be on my own schedule to explore Switzerland.

It looks like a car rental for my duration is about $600 CAD all-in (before gas/parking). I'm looking at the Swiss pass for 8 days and it shows $700 CAD, is this right? Would you recommend a pass or just pay-as-you-go?

Also the hostels I've looked up in the areas I'm staying at either the same price or more expensive than just going Airbnb. It's showing about $80-$100/night at hostels, and about $50-$85/night for Airbnbs (CAD). Am I looking at the wrong places?

mortandsmallgods,evf8bd,Being A History Buff &amp; A Solo Traveller,"This thread is for all the solo travellers out there who are also history buffs! I can't be the only one. 

Personally, I love military history. Idk, you really learn just how vulnerable humans are when you study it. That's why in my upcoming trip to France, I'm planning to spend a good amount of time in Normandy. 

I recommend Napoleon's tomb + the military museum in Paris, as well as Churchill's war rooms in London. I would love to visit more aviation museums. Also enjoyed Intrepid in New York City. Outside Budapest in a small town, I visited a ~cold war~ museum, which was pretty nifty.   

Other fields of history I love are technology and medical history. A weird highlight was visiting the hospital in Venice. Idk, I really enjoyed it? They have a musuem and tourist area with reasonable admission. Also, you'd see the odd cat around, which added to the Venetian mystery. 

Personally, history shapes my solo travel. At the end of this year, I will have a B.A in Modern History, and to celebrate, I'm going to France. So excited! 

My questions are to fellow history buffs:
1) What 'fields' or 'time periods' of history do you like?

VagabondStilettos,evgu9b,First Solo Trip a SUCCESS! (USA &gt; FR),"I went to Paris, France for my 26th birthday (just flew back into the US last night) and although my actual birthday was horrible due to the strikes closing down many stations, I had a wonderful time the rest of the days. I would like to touch on a few things that I was concerned about prior to going:

# Going to nightclubs, particularly as a woman

Surprisingly, this proved to be no issue whatsoever. I often found myself making new friends since I would fully immerse myself in the music, and dance like no one was watching. This allowed many people to come up and dance alongside me and in the end, we would exchange social media's. As a female, I would tell the men that approached me that I was there with my friends, **I would never reveal too much information about myself beyond my name and age** (for instance, if they were trying to *get to know me*, I would tell them 'it doesn't matter. I'm just trying to have a good time' and they would usually leave it at that.) I used basic common sense such as not getting shit-faced drunk, going home with strangers, leaving my drinks unattended, telling anyone where I was staying, etc. I always had a great time, and never came across anyone aggressive and yes, at times, I was making it home at around 3 in the morning (the latest I stayed out was 5:30am.)

# Going out to eat

For this, I had no issues as well. In fact, I didn't need a book or a journal while eating to keep me occupied. Instead, I would listen in on everyone's conversation. If I heard a word being used a lot, I would google its meaning (for instance, 'bah ouais' was heard all of the time!) Additionally, I would just sit and people watch or occasionally be on my phone in search of the next activity.

# Pickpockets

Never had a problem. I wore a ""fanny pack"" across my chest and kept my coat and scarf covering it since all of my essentials were in it. These were typically items I would have a hard time replacing while abroad such as my phone, money, identification, etc. Occasionally, I would tuck it underneath my arm, still underneath my coat, but this only occurred if I wasn't wearing my scarf. I never kept anything I couldn't lose in my purse, so if I were to be pickpocketed, they would be stealing cough drops, an umbrella, some tissues... maps of Paris... brochures, etc. Haha!

# Harrassment

Yes, I was catcalled several times, but not nearly as often as anticipated. I didn't wear flashy clothing, I never smiled at anyone.. no really, I never looked anyone in the face while walking or sitting on the metro. I had RBF a majority of the time, and ignored anyone that bothered to attempt. My RBF is pretty intimidating.  


If any young women also plan to travel solo, especially to France, definitely don't hesitate to PM me! I had gone to several tourist attractions as well where the men could be pretty aggressive with tourists and especially if you appear to be alone and I handled them all with ease. I was in France for 2 weeks by myself which doesn't seem like much in comparison to some people, but given that this was my very first time, I feel quite accomplished and can definitely offer what worked for me!

KeysToTheRoc,egtkho,9 days solo travel in Egypt - Itinerary advice/recommendations?,"So this is my very rough itinerary of my trip to Egypt in February. I am mainly visiting for the historical sites although I'd like to spend a couple days in a beautiful location to simply relax. I like to get off the beaten path also as it can be draining dealing with people in the tourism industry for a prolonged period of time. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Feb 8 - Cairo:** My flight is scheduled to arrive at 4 am so I was thinking of booking a hotel for the first night as hostels don't have a 24 hour check in.

**Feb 8 -10 Cairo**: Pyramids of Giza and the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities. And generally just exploring Cairo.

**Feb 11-13 - Aswan**: Will take a flight from Cairo to Aswan. Have heard many great things about Aswan although I am not sure what there is to see besides a day trip to Abu Simbel.

**Feb 14 -16 - Luxor**: Going to have to weigh up the travel options here but most likely will take the train up to Luxor. Valley of the King's and Karnak Temple are the main sites I will visit here. I will travel back to Cairo in the evening of the 16th 

**Feb 17 - Fly home**

TDLR: Cairo &gt; Aswan &gt; Luxor &gt; Cairo 

I did initially want to visit Dahab for its beauty but heard its kind of a hassle to travel to from Cairo and I can't swim so not sure if there would be any point for me.

A few other questions:

any activities you'd recommended or must visit places in Egypt? 

are the touts worse than in Morocco? I look middle eastern so I never got hassled when I wasn't hauling my luggage. 

How is the hostel scene in Egypt?",solotravel,1577554720
jml011,egtzvp,"Planning a six-month trip around the Middle East and southern Asia. Just a few questions regarding hostels, work, safekeeping bag/possessions, etc.","As the title above stated, I am gearing up for a rather long period of travel around the Fertile Crescent and into India and S.E. Asia. I plan to lean on hostels and CouchSurfing for accommodations, supplementing these with camping where applicable. Hotels and AirBnB will be distant fourth and fifth option. I have never been east of Italy and never stayed in a hostel, at least other than some run by relatively large volunteer organizations and while with a group of people I knew well. Further, I have never tried to do any work while abroad, since I've never had a trip longer than three weeks. My questions lay within these blind spots.

Work and hostels:

* So, I have saved up enough that I should be set for the entirety of the trip even if I have to pay for everything out of pocket and don't earn anything a long the way. With that said, I am always looking to cut costs where I can so that I am well-set upon my return. I have seen many people reference putting in work at a hostel in exchange for accommodations there for the night. Is this a common exchange or really more of an exception? I assume there is only so much to be done at them, and if more than just few people come looking for the same exchange, there are diminishing returns for the hostel to allow multiple people to do this.
* An extension of the above, has anyone had any luck finding temporary work (like, a few days or a week—just any kind of labor) along the way? Do you use Craigslist? Is there another recommended app I should be using? Do you just go door-to-door at businesses? What kind of legal trouble could you land in trying to find work without a visa? Any experience in this department would be greatly appreciated. 

Security.

* A few things here. First, do hostels have lockers or similar ways to store your bag during the night, or while you are out in the day? If so, do they typically have locks or should I bring my own? I plan to use a luggage lock on my bag, but should I bring a heavier padlock? Has theft in hostel (or from your hotel, CouchSurfing, or AirBnB) ever been a problem you have experienced?
* Second, would a bluetooth security device, specifically Tile, be a worthwhile investment? Are Tile users ubiquitous enough to warrant their use? I can easily imagine dropping the money on them, only for my bag to be stolen and there is still no one within the ecosystem  close enough to pick up its location—even if the thief had not found the Tile and discarded or destroyed it. How many people bother with this kind of thing? I will have my Surface Pro and my Fujifilm X-T3 set up with me, and loosing them and especially the projects I am working on contained within them are a concern. (No, I will not considered leaving them at home.)

Any advice on these subjects would be greatly appreciated. Happy Holidays!",solotravel,1577556737

I'm planning a solo trip to the Yucatan peninsula and then south into Quintana Roo in eastern Mexico for 2020.

I am currently on long trip that sometimes I have anxiety of losing my debit card since its my only source of money and it made it even worse because I had a semi unpleasant experience: 

1) on Friday evening I wanted to withdraw money from a machine that was not working. Gladly it returned the card back. However
• if the card was not returned it would be considered “void” 
• I would have to wait for the next business day (Monday) for them to perhaps open the atm and give me back my card 
• the card is void since it was not returned as normal (maybe not I am not sure) 

2) my other anxious thought is that being robbed or snitched. I sometimes think maybe its better if I withdraw a big amount in cash and keep my card at my hostel but:

kelctea,eh7usw,Calling it quits 3 weeks into a 3 month trip as a solo female,"Hey everyone. If you’re wondering what the point to this post is, good question; I probably don’t have an answer for you. I think I just need to vent to people who might be able to understand. I’m very sorry for the long post. 

For the past year and a half, I’ve worked full time in an extraordinarily stressful job in one of Australia’s largest public hospitals with one goal in mind: save enough money for a 3 month solo backpacking trip across Europe. In 2017, I was in the UK for a month solo, and I had the time of my life, so I figured I at least had some small idea of what I was getting myself into. I’m now 22 years old, about to knuckle down at uni for the next three years, and I thought “now’s the time”. 

I’d planned everything in advance, to the most minute detail. This may have been a mistake in itself, as now I have zero flexibility when I need it, but I have an anxiety disorder and wanted to have all my movements/accommodation set in stone. I landed in London on December 13th, and am now in Berlin. From here, I was planning on going to Prague, Krakow, Vienna, amongst other places, and then down into Italy. 

Problem is, where I had no issues with solo travelling on my first trip in 2017 in the UK, now I seem to be facing an uphill battle. My anxiety is through the roof, and is not being controlled by meds I have been taking (I felt absolutely fine back home). I read a lot of stories about social anxiety completely disappearing for a lot of people while they’re travelling, and I definitely found that to be true the first time I did this. However, now I’m finding myself regularly going almost 24 hours without eating, simply because I’m too petrified to navigate the language barrier with restaurants/grocery stores and make a fool of myself or upset the waiter/cashier. I’m truly terrible at navigation, so I have to be glued to Google Maps constantly when I’m out and walking around, which I feel like paints a bullseye on my back as a tourist. In addition to this crippling anxiety, I’m also incredibly sad and lonely. I’m craving human connection, and can’t help feeling that I would much rather be doing this with friends, which is insane because I barely have any friends to begin with, and the ones I do have I would detest travelling with. Because my anxiety is in overdrive, I can’t bring myself to go to a bar or anything like that to rectify this side of things, and wouldn’t feel safe doing so anyway. 

On this point, one of the other major issues is that I’m what I would describe as semi-attractive, and more so when I put in some effort. It’s very obvious that I’m alone and nervous. I’ve been assaulted by men twice in the past 24 hours, in public spaces, no less - and nobody did or said anything to stop it. I just completely froze up and kept saying “please stop, please stop, please stop” over and over again until eventually a well-timed distraction would come about, like my train arriving on the platform. 

In Berlin, I’m staying in a hostel which has 8 beds - 7 are currently occupied by a group of Indian men, and I am the only female. I have another week here. It is extremely awkward for me, and they have been showing me some attention, to the point where I enquired at reception if I could be moved to a room with more females, but the staff refused, saying that they don’t keep track of which genders are staying in their dorms. If I move hostels now, I lose about $300AUD. 

With this anxiety, and these experiences over the past while, I’m considering just pulling the pin and heading home. I honestly don’t feel confident heading further east, if I’m having this much trouble now. My family is extremely disappointed in me, and keep reminding me of this wonderful opportunity that I’m throwing away, as if that isn’t already at the forefront of my mind.

But I’m not happy. I’m not enjoying my time here. I’m completely torn. I’ve wanted this for so long, to see these places and live these experiences, but I’m concerned that my headspace is not conducive to getting through this in one piece. I mean, I’m barely even eating. 

So, my question - what would you do? Would you soldier through, with everything booked and all travel paid for in advance, feeling shit scared and lonely but also knowing this is what you worked for? Or would you fork out what amounts to be almost the rest of your money to return home early, to safety, but also to a family who wishes you were still gone? (My family loves me, by the way. They just have a habit of living vicariously through me and are taking even the suggestion of my coming home as a personal affront, as if they themselves are here with me and I’m forcibly dragging them onto the plane too).

Hey reddit. I am just making an updated post to see what you guys think of my plans with the feedback I got, everyone was so helpful in my previous one and I want to thank you guys for taking the time to reply!

Again, I’ll be in Japan for a month (early March to early April) for my first solo trip and first time in Asia. Like I mentioned in my other post, I am looking to see what you guys think about my plans and if I should visit other districts!

I keep being undecided with certain things, and I’m totally afraid I might miss out on a cool town to stop by! I tried my best to make changes to my previous plan.

In brackets are places I already bought rooms for, so I can’t change that.  
If I put “?”, it is not confirmed yet and I am unsure about it.

**Here’s my plan by the weeks in order:**

**Week 1 =**

\- 7 days Tokyo (already confirmed for the whole week in Ikebukero and Shibuya)

**Week 2** = I’ll be taking JR pass here, unsure if I should buy 7 or 14 day pass yet to be cheaper…

\- 2 days Kanazawa?

\- 2 days Takayama?

\- 1 day Nagoya in Sakae?

\- 2 days Fukuoka in Hakata (already confirmed)

**Week 3 =**

\- 1 day yufuin? (not confirmed, but likely going with a friend)

\- 2 days Nagasaki ?

\- 2 days Hiroshima?

\- 1 day ??? where to go/stay extra? 1d okoyama maybe? No idea

**Week 4 (if I get 14d pass for JR, runs out day I get to Kobe) =**

\- 2 days Kobe in Sannomiya?

\- 2 days ??? I would love to find a fun district with very little to no tourism and experience local life and maybe go for a beer in a fun non-tourist place/meet locals who are surprised to see someone visiting their town. Looking for it to be cheap to get to Kyoto/Osaka by train since I don’t have JR anymore. Any suggestions? Someone suggested N or S Kyoto, not sure though

**Week 5 =** \*during this week, a day trip to Nara and maybe Himeji will happen

\- 5 days Kyoto

\- 3 days Osaka

I know some weeks don’t add to 7 days in it, just found it easier to explain my travel situation like that. I also have 1 week in Tokyo again when I get back to Japan from other country.

*- Please let me know what you think about it?*  
*- Do you suggest I change anything about it?*  
*- Other places I should add to visit or switch anything around?*  
*- Overall, is it good plan and what places to visit within it?*

Anything you mention is helpful! Again, I hope to meet people along the way, have a bit of time to explore less touristy things as well, and also have fun doing activities (like traditional things) during day and feel a sense of nightlife sometimes too (izakayas, bars, events, etc.)

Day 7/8, I'm at a bit of a loss for. The train ride between Zurich and Munich is pretty long, and I want to see Neuschwantein, so I figured I'd stop somewhere and break it up that way. I'm not really sure where though. Kempton looks to be the biggest city on a map along the general route, but I don't know if there is somewhere better to stop? Is Neuschwantein even worth it?

How interesting is Geneva? I'm not a city/party/nightlife person in the slightest so I figured I'd be better off getting out into less populated areas right away the morning after arriving. (I did that with Glasgow on a previous trip and don't regret it at all). When I'm visiting bigger cities I tend to just visit a few important buildings/museums and that's about it.

For context, I'm an early 30's Canadian white guy who loves food, hectic cities and fish-out-of-water experiences.  I'm not interested in temples or towers or ruins or (most) typical ""tourist things,"" I get a lot more enjoyment from just walking the streets with a camera and an empty stomach.

My concern with Singapore is that it seems tame and very expensive.  I'm from Vancouver and I've spent a lot of time in Hong Kong, so crowded malls full of wealthy Chinese people speaking English aren't much of a novelty for me.  The price is also an issue- I can definitely afford to go, but I'd be priced out of the higher end hotels/restaurants/shopping and feel like I'm missing out.

Kolkata is my other option, but I'm afraid it might be too extreme in the opposite direction.  A lot of people (mostly Indian) have cautioned me against it, saying the pollution/poverty is overwhelming.  I also worry that it would be harder to meet people there- I'm fine spending my days solo, but it's nice to be able to meet tourists/locals for dinner and drinks.

Whichever one I pick, it'd be for ~3 nights starting January 20th.

All told, I rode about 23,000 KM (\~14,300 miles) in 40 days. Yes, I took the scenic route!

I camped (tent and/or hammock) probably 35 of the 40 days.

Some of the spots I hit include (but not limited to):

Provinces: New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario

States: Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine

National Parks: Rocky Mountain, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Escalante, Arches, Big Bend, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Death Valley, Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Joshua Tree, Mesa Verde

The video also includes quite a bit of off road action, most of the fun stuff coming from the 100 mile White Rim Road in Utah (5 dismounts there alone, I think).

My ride was a 2015 Suzuki V-Strom 650. It performed flawlessly, 2 oil changes and one rear tire were all it needed. And as you will see from the video, I didn't baby it!

Anyway, hope you enjoy watching as much as I did making it.

itsSebber,ehm0z9,"Good places to stay in Busan, South Korea","Hello fellow solo travelers,

need some help here! :) 

I'm planning my trip to South Korea (end of April, beginning of May) and I wanted to spend 3/4 days in Busan.

From what I've read, it's a vibrant artsy city with a very cool creative scene. I'd like to stay in a hostel to have a chance to meet other travelers, but I'm not a big fan of party hostels (I'm a bit ""older"", I'm super ok with staying in or going to pubs for drinks, but the idea of a dancing crowd keeping me awake all night doesn't really sound cool).

Do you have any suggestions? Any tips for me?

That'd be very much appreciated! 

Thank you!",solotravel,1577712400
Woosharoundtg,ehmfog,24 and 21 year old brothers traveling to Italy from New York in June 2020 (not completely solo),"Hey reddit! I’m taking my little brother to Italy on June 8th and showing him around Italy for 10 days. I’ve spent a total of 6 months in Italy already so I know it fairly well. The only countries my brother has been to are Canada and the Bahamas. His birthday is in May so I figured I’d take him to Italy since he’s wanted to go for so long. My plan is to show him Rome, Cinque Terre, Venice, and Florence. 

We will be landing in Rome on the 9th and staying 2 nights until the 11th. On the 11th, we will take a train to Cinque Terre and stay for 3 nights. On the 14th we will be taking a train to Venice and stay 2 nights. On the 16th we will be going to Florence and staying for 2 nights. On the 18th, we would be going back to Rome and he will go home that afternoon. 

I’ll be in Rome a bit longer. I’m not completely sure what my plans will be after he leaves. I definitely won’t be going back to the states. I don’t really have any plans from then on until late August/early September, so I’m open to Ideas. 


We will be staying in hostels. All of which are rated above 9 on hostelworld. Two of the hostels I’ve been to myself so I can vouch for them and the other two are hostels my friends have recommended to me. For the ones I haven’t been to, the reviews on hostelworld sing the same praises my friends have. Overall, the total cost for all of the hostels we will be staying at during our trip is $325 usd per person, so that’s about €290. 

In Rome we will be seeing the main sights, most of which are free. As far as paid activities go, we will go into the colosseum, and go to the Vatican. Our time in Rome will be spent walking around the city and one night we will be doing the colosseum bar crawl. 

In Cinque Terre we will only do 2 small paid activities.  One is the hike from Corniglia to Vernazza, which is cheap and only requires a Cinque Terre Card. If you’re not used to hikes, don’t worry, it’s easy, and this is coming from a guy who did it out of shape and sick. The other paid activity is renting a beach chair in Monterosso al Mare. Our trip to Cinque Terre will be spent relaxing in the water, going on one hike, and trying some local foods. 

Next trip is Venice. The paid activities will be Doge’s Palace and a gondola ride. Our time in Venice will be spent exploring and trying local foods. 

Last stop is Florence. We are doing the Duomo, and Galleria dell’Accademia as the paid activities. If we have more time than we may see another sight as well. Mostly we will be exploring the many free sights in Florence and eating some great food, of course. 


If you’re interested in tagging along with us on our 4 location trip, we would be happy to have you. Or if you’d like to make travel plans with me for after my brother leaves then feel free to comment or send me a message. I’m open to suggestions for what to do when my brother leaves, so we could plan something together, or if you’re already doing something then I’ll tag along.",solotravel,1577714813
unofficial_stig,ehmos3,Torn b/t Morocco and Vietnam,"Hi everyone. I'm debating swapping Morocco for Vietnam after reading about a lot of solo and non-solo traveler's experiences in the former. I've been curious about going to Morocco for about a year now, but these accounts make me feel like I wouldn't have as good of a trip. Are these worries valid? Is it worth going even if there may be constant hassle from locals? Would I run into the same sort of thing in Vietnam?

An alternative I've thought of for Morocco would be to do a tour. I've never traveled with a tour group before, but I've heard good things about Intrepid tours, and it may help to avoid some of the street-level hassles I've heard about. They offer a tour specifically for people ages 18-29, which piques my interest. Does anyone have experience with their tours?

I’ll be getting to Buenos Aires next week on the 6th with the end destination for flying home from Rio just after New Years.

Afterwards I’ll make my way up to Iguazu for a few nights and cross my way into Brazil by land. How easy is it and any suggestions? I did see that Americans no longer need a visa which is awesome. 

From there leaves me about the 16th until about the 27th open when I need to get to Rio since all the hostels want a minimum 5 or 6 night booking for New Years. 

Where should I go in Brazil for those 10 days? I want to go to Florianopolis for sure and I’ve heard mixed reviews on Sao Paolo. If there’s an Amazon experience available close by I’d be interested but the only ive seen are nowhere close to where I’ll be. I do love sporting events and if there are any in either county at the time I’d want to go. I went to a futbol game in Medellin and it was incredible. 

Lastly the language barrier in Brazil. By the time I get there I’ll have 2 months of South American Spanish practice but I don’t know I word of Portuguese. May need to just learn a few phrases over the next few weeks.

ShepardtoyouSheep,e3vfd6,Week in Belgium,"Thought I'd give a complete breakdown of our trip to Belgium this last week for others who might be interested in going.

Budget: Under $1,500 

Trip Length: 6 days

Destination: Brussels

Accomodations: Studio apartment AirBnB


Activities: 

- Beer Museum

- European History Museum

- Life in Brussels Museum

- Comic Strip Museum

- Day trip to Bruges

- Torture Museum

- Museum of Art and History


What went right: Overall we absolutely loved our entire trip and would love to head back at some point. When we do head back, we won't be spending much of our time in Brussels again though and will aim for more time in Bruges and other smaller cities. We loved all the various museums and architecture of the city.


What went wrong: Nothing went extremely wrong, but there were a few items that we would have enjoyed happening differently or not at all. First, our Airbnb was located on an extremely busy street and that meant a ton of noise every single night. Second, we got in at 8am, which is normally great, but we didn't sleep at all on the flight over so we were exhausted on day 1 and couldn't get into our lodging until 2pm. We basically just sat around and waited to get into it so we could take a quick nap before hitting the town. Lastly, we did have an interesting interaction with a man on the street one morning. As I was locking the door my fiance waited on the sidewalk when a man approached her and asked if she spoke English. When I entered the sidewalk he looked at both of us and turned to my fiance and said ""Fuck you"" and stormed off.


Recommendations: Research your lodging and read all the reviews you can. Don't be afraid to ask questions about it or the neighborhood it's in.


Final Verdict: Would go again.



Full cost breakdown:

- Flights: $275 round trip each

- Airbnb: $300 for 6 nights

- Day 1: $70 (travel day, groceries, and a few pints)

- Day 2: $35 (Museum of European History and walking in parks)

- Day 3: $60 (Grand Place, beer museum, Brussels Museum, groceries)

- Day 4: $115 (Comic museum, gifts, dinner)

- Day 5: $215 Trip to Bruges

- Day 6: $60 Museum of Art and History

Saturday I want to see the Stock Yards then I have a tour scheduled for the Cowboys stadium. Early Monday morning I will head to NO and the game is at 7PM. I plan on staying until Wednesday morning.

If it matters, I am Male and 23; most places I will either stay in hotels or hostels with private rooms. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My Itinerary: (Mid Jan - Early Feb; 28 days / 27 nights total)**

* Tokyo (1 night)
   * Required to connect here, am able to do a 18 hour layover overnight at no additional cost \[cannot make longer; I am wanting to do this toget me excited to come back to Japan\]
* Beijing (2 nights)
   * Required to connect here, was planning on adding a day to see Great Wall of China and Forbidden City over two full days and some exploring to take advantage of 144 hour pass
   * Will I have any issues if I arrive from Japan via PEK and leave for Vietnam on a non-stop from PKX?
* Da Nang / Hoi An / Hue (6 nights)
   * Looking to get 2 custom suits tailored and mailed back to USA so need some time to do it, explore Da Nang and Hoi An, spend a small amount of time at beach and ""relax"", debating a 1-2 night excursion to Hue. I got a feeling I could probably cut some of this out. 
   * Is Hue worth it?
* Hanoi / Ninh Binh (5 nights)
   * Looking to explore old quarters, do a lot with food and see a few sites, might consider an overnight or two night excursion to Ninh Binh as it seems least painful to get to and not quite as touristy as Halong Bay
   * Is Ninh Binh worth it?
* Siem Reap (2 nights)
   * Get in late, spend a full day doing Angkor Wat, see the town closer to night, leave early final morning
* Bangkok (2 nights)
   * Not really sure to be honest, taking Bangkok in?
* Chiang Mai (3 nights)
   * Get in relatively early, spend first day exploring, second day doing elephant sanctuary or somewhere ethical, third day doing something? Not sure.
* Islands in Thailand (4 nights)
   * No idea which island, but would likely need to be near Phuket or Krabi. Looking at Ao Nang or Koh Lanta right now. Want somewhere where I can go to beach, swim, maybe snorkel or take a private boat and tan, or kayak around. Preferably not aggressively overrun by tourist like Italy is or party central. Something relaxing. Looked at Ko Chang but found it too hard to get overthere.
* Singapore (1 night)
   * Required to connect here to get back to USA.",solotravel,1575152371

So I’m planning on:

London - Amsterdam - Berlin - Prague - Budapest, from June 10th - July 1st. 

So I guess my main curiosities about this whole lifestyle is:

- Are weekends important for going out like in the States? I didn’t want to miss out on nightlife because let’s say I’m in a place on a Tuesday or Wednesday instead of Friday or Saturday.

- I have an idea on which hostels to go to, but I don’t know if I should get a private room for myself or stay in a public room, I really don’t mind either. The trip is a graduation gift, so I can ball out, but I’d rather keep a budget just to help the parents. 

- How many days should I spend in each place?

- Any cities I should fit in if there’s room?

- Train travel? Lmao I honestly don’t know, they don’t have these in the suburbs.

Полигональная кладка в Дельфах, мегалиты в Тиринфе и идеально выпиленные блоки в Микенах. Технологии, о которых греки периода Архаики и Классики знать не знали. О многих из них не знают и сейчас. Каменными и медными орудиями труда сделать такое невозможно. Откуда же взялись эти стены, дома и прочие руины? Кто и когда их построил.

Все города классической Греции так или иначе привязаны к морю, к портам. Вся экономика полисов была связана с торговлей, а торговля - это море. Были свои исключения. Например, Спарта. Но у нее были свои порты на побережье. А вот Микены. Город в предгорьях, до воды 20 километров. Зачем он здесь. И точнее, когда он был построен. Официально XIII-XI вв до н.э. И слои этого периода можно действительно увидеть на городище. Это кривой рваный камень, сложенный в толстые стены, среди которые прорублены условные ворота-проходы.

А вот под этими «самыми старыми» слоями находятся абсолютно ровные блоки, у которых есть выпилы, сняты фаски и имеются пропилы с идеально ровной поверхностью. Причем пропил имеет форму углубления, одна стенка которого абсолютно плоская, а вторая сколота. Так пилят камень в наше время при помощи дисковых пил. А в Микенах такие блоки лежат в основании пола строений XIII века до нашей эры. То есть микенцы строили свои дома на еще более древних руинах, от которых остались только плиты пола. Стены и своды не сохранились, либо были использованы при строительстве в виде битого камня. Вывод прост. Под более грубым и нетехнологичным слоем мы видим архитектурные предметы более технологичной обработки. Разумеется, в официальном описании Микен как археологического памятника упоминания об этих блоках и пропилах вы не найдете.

Но есть и более очевидные вещи, которые не спрячешь ни от кого. Это герб со львами над воротами города. Вроде бы все просто – символ династии и т.п. Но только через центр герба до его середины в продольном плане вновь идет пропил. Тут уже без сколов. Именно до середины, то есть пилить обычной медной пилой, которая работает по всей дине, было не возможно. Такой пропил возможен только при наличии именно дисковой пилы. Второй вопрос – зачем вообще понадобилось пилить герб пополам. Сравнивая технологию его изготовления и соседние грубые стены, складывается полное ощущение, что его сюда принесли или из другого места, или, скорее всего, нашли на уже имевшихся здесь руинах, и встроили в новый город в XIII веке до н.э.

В пользу последней версии говорят массивные прямоугольные блоки, из которых сложены сами ворота и прилегающие стены. Они сильно контрастируют с другими постройками, да и с самой крепостной стеной. Здесь технология кладки из многотонных квадров была, а рядом не было? Или ворота сложили из валявшихся в округе обломков предыдущего города?

На такую мысль наталкивают гробницы микенского типа. Правда, к ним приписывают два разнородных по структуре типа памятников. Это купольные склепы высотой до 20 метров в округе Микен. Они выложены в линейно идеальной структуре, перекрытия выполнены из блоков весом более 100 тонн. А есть многочисленная группа склепов подобной формы, но сложенная криво, из рваного камня, из которого построена большая часть стен Микен. Не говорит ли это о подобии, но не равенстве? Что кто-то, то есть микенцы времен Агамемнона, нашли остатки былой культуры, от которой мало что сохранилось в самом городе, но подземные склепы были не повреждены. Они вторично использовали обломки для строительства нового города в XIII веке. А в могилы положили своих царей, считая эти места святыми. Не так ли поступили советские вожди с Кремлевской стеной, возведенной за 500 лет до них? И не так ли делали фараоны III-IV династий с Великими пирамидами?

Кстати, дромос, то есть вход-коридор в курган Агамемнона вроде сложен подобно основой кладке. Но ряды в нем кривые. То есть построен он был не создателями гробницы, а теми, кто пытался, но не умел следовать предложенной технологии.

К размышлению. Лабиринт круглой формы с впускными гробницами в нижней части Микен. Аналога ему в Греции я не видел, но встречал подобное на Мальте. Подобная структура там относится на 7 тысяч лет назад. Она также сложена из грубого камня, но имеет совершенно чуждую для всех остальных построек в округе форму. И построена она была также позже разрушения зданий из блоков с пропилами.

Не менее интересен соседний Тиринф. В его центральной и самой высокой части, под грудой мелкого «самого древнего» камня в изобилии представлены блоки с пропилами. Причем пропилы имеют длину в несколько метров, оконтуривая прежнюю площадь разрушенного помещения. Уже поверх этих квадров выстроена огромная толстенная стена. Причем выстроена она методом простого навала грубых камней, без всякой рядности. В ней имеются проходы-ворота с перекрытием в виде ступенчатого свода.

То есть строители этих стен не могли перекрыть портал крупным блоком. Они не знали, как поднимать тяжелые камни. Но при этом в полу города уложены камни со следами совершенно иной технологичной обработки.

Кто основал Микены и Тиринф? Как были обработаны камни, из которых построены эти города? Для этого нужно копать глубже, разбирать грубые поделки XIII века до н.э. Добираться до основания скалы. Но на это современная наука пойти не может. Ведь в первую очередь любой археологический объект – это зрелище. Не важно, что на 70% - это реконструкция второй половины XX века. Но она имеет «фасад», она совпадает с официальной теорией. Чтобы на нее посмотреть, сюда едут сотни тысяч туристов, которые смотрят, но не видят, не думают.

Но самое интересное наследие догреческой Греции – это Дельфы. Храм Аполлона, легенда о пупе земли, камне, брошенном Зевсом с небес.

Посмотри на камни глазами скептика. Уберем реконструированные колонны – главный задник для всех фотографий, и посмотрим на основание. А в основании настоящая полигональная кладка. Блоки не идут в ряд. Они сложены, словно кривой тетрис. При этом грани настолько идеально прилегают друг к другу, что лезвие не везде можно просунуть. Подумайте, как можно вырезать камень в скале с кривыми гранями так, чтобы он идеально совпал с 4-5 блоками, лежащими вокруг него? Без компьютера, на глаз. Никак! Любой архитектор и дизайнер скажет, что камни резали по трафарету на единой поверхности, а потом воссоздавали на новом месте.

Аналогичную полигональную платформу я видел в Перу и в Иране в Персеполе. Причем старая ограда Дельф, в которой уже были прорублены проходы в античное время, к которой пристроен верхний стадион, также имеет подобную кладку. Ни один гид, ни один путеводитель о ней не упоминает.

Храм Аполлона стоит на этой платформе, его основание выложены из подобных блоков. И во всех легендах говориться, что это место уже было святым в Архаический период истории Греции, в нем жил сам Аполлон. А большинство стен и храмов – это уже позднее напластование. Кстати, внизу, в старом храме Афины, в строении, относимом к до-Архаическому периоду также встречается полигональная кладка.

Наличие факта мы удостоверили. Понимаем, что греки построить это не могли. Потому что, если могли, то и дальше строили так же по всей Греции. Зачем? Это идеальная кладка в сейсмоопасных регионах. В ней нет ни вертикальных, ни горизонтальных слое. По сути, это монолит из мозаики. Он не рушится при толчках. Все блоки находятся словно в замке. Нет оси разрушения. Если бы это строили греки, то весь полуостров был бы застроен только такими домами, которым не страшна сила вулканов и земли. Но нет, такого больше нет нигде.

Кто же это построил? Греки сами отвечают на этот вопрос. Их боги, которые и жили в таких строениях. И под ними они понимали не Творца, а более сильных, живущих дольше, но все же людей. Святость появилась тогда, когда ушло понимание и знание. Осталась вера и непонимание. Ведь для полинезийцев в Тихом океане белые солдаты тоже были богами, они молились им. По-настоящему. Ведь те могли летать на стальных птицах.

Я долго искал подобную кладку в храме Аполлона в Бассах. Ничего. Предыдущее строение было полностью снесено и на его место выстроен абсолютно новый храм. Хотя по древности и святости место не уступает Дельфам.

Продолжаем искать. Египет, Иран, Ливан, Израиль, Палестина, Перу, Боливия – в этих странах можно убедиться, что технологии Айфона окажутся допотопными по сравнению с наследием цивилизации (ий), присутствовавшей на нашей планете около 12 тысяч лет назад.

So far I've seen Lub D Silom pop up as recommend quite a bit, and I've also got my eye on Luk Hostel and Holy Sheet hostel.

Downside is that the north will be chilly with little day light this time of the year. I've been to AMS before so no pressure on exploring that city.

**This will be my 5th solo adventure to Europe! Thanks for all the sage guidance from** r/solotravel **over the years.** 

Budget: I am a grad student working part time so low cost options are preferred.

Hypothetical 1:

Fly to Lisbon, 2-3 nights.

Train to Porto, 2-3 nights

Fly back to AMS, 2 nights.

\*potentially fit Malaga, Spain into the itinerary.

I plan to use a combo of airBnB and hostels. Considering Porto for a studio airBnB apt. Cost seem to be lower and generally more comfortable with a river view (around 30 usd a night). That would leave Lisbon as my hostel option. Any critiques on this plan? Would one city be a better hostel scene over the other? Any pro tips?

AMS will likely be a hostel due to cost. Max budget will be 35 usd a night. Last trip to AMS I stayed at St. Chris. Location was good but I wouldn't repeat due to the cleanliness. However, the social aspect was great.

Hypothetical 2:

Trying to plan an option that includes Vienna, Slovenia, and possibly Croatia. I'm interested after researching these areas and have not yet visited this region. Any pro tips to get me started on this plan?

Hypothetical 3:

St. Petes and Moscow. This plan will likely not be possible due to higher cost of airfare and the need for visa. Maybe next time!",solotravel,1572455869

Doing many things for the first time : travelling solo/boarding a plane/ going to a place without any known people or particular or motive* .. etc. Mainly wants to connect to safe ,good people nd make this a memorable journey. Tips?","Tldr:  the title mainly .    

Although the last line is a little misleading: There is this event happening in Chennai that i am a part of, so i am mainly going there to attend that . But i will be there a day earlier so i was thinking of living some of my childish fantasies to roam in some unknown place, visit some interesting places, meet people eat some cool cuisine and other stuff, for 1 day.   

I have planned this journey  thoroughly, read it below. Mainly this 1 day could be handled in either **Adventure mode** : where i check in to hotel, go out visit places , meet people and make this memorable or **cowardly safemode** : where i check in to my hotel, take a big nap, then watch movies on my phone and do some work for full day .    

I am all about going full Adventure mode but my thing is , am hell of an awkward, simpleton and stupid personna . Wanna read more of my foolishness then read the later paras.    


I was mainly here wondering for tips regarding safe travel, particularly in respect to the part where you talk to anonymous ppl.   
   

# Questions  

-  how do you judge which person is good or which person is a red flag to talk to?    

- Also,if you like gaining local culture knowledge,  will you just  grab some random local citizen and casually start asking questions? How do you start?(and am not talking about those monuments and tourist places. For eg, you are interested in a (unique for you but common for locals) mailbox. )  

- What information you think should never be given to a stranger and which information ( like your name, country name, etc ) you feel is okay to share to that random stranger? ( Obviously bank accounts , cash details, etc are things which we  should never talk about. But am talking about  things related to you or your journey : like accomodation info, your plans for visiting places, etc . Which beans will you spill nd which you wouldn't,in order to talk to someone)

Also ,note that stranger here could mean 2 types of people: the one that i will meet in the event, probably also tourists, sharing common interests , useful to my career growth and might meet me in some other event. Or the trues strangers , the  local people there, someone near our previous mailbox?   
 

# about my plannings  


I am carrying 2 bags and i have around 3 backups of my tickets and id. My other bag is mainly clothes , but my main bag would have some electricals like chargers earphones, powerbanks , etc . I am carrying some cash, all put at different places, along with a debit card and some money in ewallets. I have  some zippers and safety pins if anything goes wrong. My hotel is booked but i will be paying when i reach there... Well that's pretty much it. Let me know if i should look into some other thing    


# about me  
I am 21 and am still making a lot of mistakes.... Sigh.  I am mainly introvert( can't talk to people/won't talk to people... Sadly both are same for me) , simpleton (got scammed many times , the latest one just a month ago ), a single child ( i tell you its not so goody. My parents are super extra over-caring : my mom used to watch over me when i went to a tution in class 10th, all the way until i was out of sight , a tution that wasn't even 200 mtrs away!) And so less confident.  
I am taking steps to change what i could, and this journey was a part of it. I took it because not only this was a great event that i could attend, but i am in the volunteer team meaning i have a reason to interact with people somewhat. Plus this would be an event where there might be people with similar interests there. I just ...

sorcererballer,dpdh6y,Just booked a trip to Cuba! My first solo trip in 9 years and I am PUMPED.,"I can definitely say that solo travel and worldwide exploration is pretty much my greatest joy and passion in life, but I have sadly been on hiatus for the last 9 years due to parenthood.  But at long last, with the full blessing of family, I am able to get away and answer the call to adventure!

It's only for a week, but Cuba has been on my list for 20 years.  I'm not even really going to plan much; just grab a Lonely Planet and browse the r/Cuba sub and see what happens.

Being a solo traveler was such a essential part of my identity, it was really hard to give it up during these years of early childhood parenting.  I think becoming a parent can be a bit of an identity-crushing experience as it is.  I honestly feel quite out of touch with the ""Essential Me"" and I am really hoping to take this upcoming journey to reconnect with that part of myself that is a distant memory.  The part that finds no greater thrill than just to step off a plane in an unknown and completely foreign environment, with all that I need on my back, with the freedom to go wherever I please, to set my sails and see where the wind blows.  Experiences like that  will bring me back to my core.

And the best part--this is just the first trip!  With my family on board, this kind of thing can happen regularly for me now, and longer and in more far-flung locations as the children age.  WOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

Jan 4-7 | Krakow, Poland
Jan 7-8 | Sanok, Poland
Jan 8-11 | Budapest
Jan 11-12 | Amsterdam
Jan 12 | Amsterdam-MSP

In Berlin I plan on visiting museums, going to a New Years Eve party (Possibly Discotheque? not sure which party is best), and I would also like to go to a rave/disco, because that's the stereotype I think of when I think of Berlin haha.

No definitive plans as of yet for Prague.

In Krakow I would like to visit the salt mines and Auschwitz. I would also like to explore the city, and I feel like these tours would take full days so I might try to take a night train/bus to give me more time. 

The only reason I'm going to Sanok is because it has a museum with a Zdzislaw Beksinski gallery. He's probably my favorite artist, so I feel like I can't pass up an opportunity to see his work in person. This would also give me a small break from cities, and I couldn't find any hostels here so I would likely get a hotel room for myself.

In Budapest I would explore the city, ruin bars, museums, etc. Haven't thought too much about it yet.

I didn't originally plan on Amsterdam, but the best flight I could find time-wise and money-wise out of Budapest had an overnight layover in Amsterdam, so I figured might as well. I do plan to go out at night and ideally not miss my 11AM flight back to America.

Thoughts: Should I spend more time in Budapest/Krakow? I've heard two nights in Prague is enough, so I'm considering cutting my stay in Berlin a night short -- Although I already booked the hostel for 5 nights, so hopefully they would let me drop a night without canceling the whole reservation. I hope to budget roughly $1500 (USD) for the trip, EXCLUDING travel costs, so roughly $100 per night - Hopefully this is excessive, but I feel like I might spend a good amount in Berlin and Amsterdam. I would like to go out for at least one night in each city, but I'm not a party animal so it definitely won't be every night. I also plan on not splurging too much on food/drink, and I'll try to buy groceries a couple times if possible.

jon_show,dpkbjv,35 Days in South East Asia,"Hey everyone. So I'm a 20 year old male who's gonna graduate from college next May. I'm planning on travelling to South East Asia for a little over a month. The reason I can't travel for longer is due to my Indian parents who refuse to see their son being a vagrant for more than a month. 

I know 35 days is too less, but I've crafted somewhat of an itinerary that doens't involve me just going to a place, seeing a few sights and leaving. This has however led me prioritize certain places over the others and I feel like I'm missing out on some big cultural attraction or event. Keep in mind that I'll be staying mostly in hostels, both to bring down the the cost and to get some drinking/partying done after a long day.

def_cats,dpkcsf,"Can someone explain what I just experienced? (Hongdae, Seoul, South Korea)","So I was walking to my hostel in Seoul, I was walking off of the main road so there were only a few people on the street, but it wasn’t empty at all. I was listening to music and this Korean couple stopped me as I was walking and asked if I knew where the Harry Potter Cafe was. I said no sorry but I could look it up for them if they wanted me to. They were insistent that I didn’t and that they’d be fine and it didn’t matter if they found it or not. 

They were totally friendly, and asked me if I worked for NASA (I was wearing a NASA t-shirt), then asked if it was my first time in Seoul. Anyway we were standing there chatting for about 2 minutes and it was really a pleasant encounter. I admit they seemed a little too excited to be talking to me, something just seemed a little bit off. 

Then another Korean couple walks by and as they walked behind the couple that was talking to me the male turns to me and starts shaking his head and mouthing “no no no” while making an X with his arms like this 🙅‍♂️

I acted like I didn’t see anything and as the couple turned the corner the guy yelled something like “they’re _____”. I didn’t catch what he said. 
The girl that was standing in front of me turns and says “what did he say?” And I said “I’m not sure honestly”. Then the girl says “oh it’s because there is a lot of crime in Seoul” then she says a few things in Korean to her boyfriend and she starts to act like she barely understands English even though they were talking totally fine before. Anyway they continued to be friendly and keep the conversation going but I cut them off shortly after, wished them the best, and walked away. They smiled and bowed to me and shook my hand and left. 

I admit, I always have my guard up when I’m abroad since I travel alone but nothing about this seemed like they were trying to scam me. I know a common scam is for someone to take you out for tea or whatever and charge you a ton of money but they never tried to ask me to go anywhere. They were young, probably no older than 24. The look on the guys face who waved at me wasn’t one of annoyance at a scam, it was more like he was scared and worried. 

It was an extremely bizarre experience. I asked my hostel owner about it and he just shrugged it off and said not to worry about it. I want to know what you guys think. Thoughts?",solotravel,1572508811

Half the time there is little to no shade, the heat and humidity is unbearable and there's not really anywhere to get water within walking distance because the place is HUGE Like 390 square miles huge.

Either rent scooters and stock up or go with a guide who will supply you with free water. (I recommend a guide as you get an air conditioned mini van to shuttle you round).

NachoGaucho,dpz6zp,First solo euro trip planning: advice &amp; comments welcomed!," 

Hello all, 

Booked my first European solo trip for 73 days, flying into Madrid mid-aril and out of London late June. 

Been wanting to do a Europe trip for a long time and recently received my Italian citizenship which was the final push I needed to go experience it, also explains why itinerary is Italy heavy because I want to experience and live in the culture my family used to. 

Budget is around 7,000-8,000 USD (excluding tickets to madrid and out of london) and Im planning of getting an EU Rail continuous pass for 3 months. The flexibility of the pass looks really good and travelling by train feels like a better experience than budget airlines or busses even if it cost me a couple of hundred bucks more (counting additional reservations). Train rides I have planned right now look reasonable with the exception of 3-4 long trips.

My current thought is to pre-book all hostels now so I can enjoy the experience at good ones and I feel like my flexibility won’t be affected since most offer free-cancellation around 24-72hrs before, in case anything last minute comes up. Would appreciate advice on the way im planning to do it &amp; any hostel recommendation you might have!

Im a mid 20’s male, I love history &amp; sports. Im really looking forward to meeting new people (travellers &amp; locals ), enjoying the sites &amp; nightlife and learning new cultures. I speak spanish &amp; english and gonna try to learn some Italian before I leave.

Been planning and playing around for a couple of weeks now and would love some comments, advice or opinions on itinerary / hostels / transportation / possible day trips &amp; fun activities. Croatia, Greece, Istanbul and Central/Eastern Europe are gonna have to wait for another trip so its not too tight (it may be too tight as it is, let me know)

Thanks to all !! 

Current itinerary plan: 

* Madrid  (3 nights) - arrive around 2pm local time.
* Sevilla  (3 nights)
* Granada  (2 nights)
* Barcelona  (5 nights) - 
* Marseille  (2 nights) - or another southern france city/town, haven’t decided yet
* Nice-Monaco (3 nights) 
* Milan  (1 night) - a night stop so trip to Switzerland is not too long.
* Interlaken / Gimmewald (4 nights) - looks beautiful &amp; like to hike so I think the extra money is worth it
* Milan  (3 nights)  - Lake como day trip
* Cinque terra (3 nights)  
* Florence  (3 nights) - thinking of day trip to Bologne/Modena to check out Ferrari / Pagani.
* Siena (3 nights)
* Rome ( 5 nights)
* Naples  (4 nights) - Almafi coast + capri + pompei day trips (not sure if too stay in the city or around like Pompeii or sorrento)
* Venice (2 nights)
* Slovenia ( 3 nights) (Lake bled or Bohinj) - looks beautiful &amp; like an ideal spot to relax and take a break from cities.
* Munich ( 3 nights) - possible day trip to Salzburg 
* Prague (4 nights)
* Berlin (4 nights)
* Amsterdam  (3 nights)

Argentina (Mendoza, Buenos Aires) 2 weeks

Uruguay (Montevideo, Colonia) 1 weeks

Peru (Lima, Cusco, Machu Picchu) 2 weeks

On the surface it is Uruguay that is probably going to be the most expendable but in my mind it might be Peru that's most expendable and if 2 weeks isn't enough then return another time and do Peru/Ecuador.

unicornarealive,daznyz,Long term travel: Preparations and check list,"I (female, 29) put in my 3 months notice. I have a budget of 35 000 $ and I'll start my travels in January. I'll travel to Sri Lanka first and then go with the flow. I'll focus on SEA (I'm into surfing) and then head to Japan and Korea. Maybe also I'll add to some countries in Africa if my budget allows it. I know there are plenty of ressources on the interwebbzzz but I'd like to hear your experiences.

Some questions for experienced long term travelers out there:

* **Insurance:** I have mandatory health and accident insurance back home which would cover 90% of costs for emergencies abroad. I also have houshold contents insurance which covers items stolen abroad and liability insurance. Should i go for an additional travel insurance? What should it cover?
* **Budget &amp;** **Methods of payements:** Credit, debit, cash, revolut? Whats the best way to avoid fees? Do your track your daily or weekly expenses? 
* **Packing list:** What's an item you absolutely recommend to pack, that one might forget?
* **Apps:** What are your must-need travel apps?
* **Hostels:** I'm not into partying anymore. I'd love to meet people my age. Best tipps to avoid party hostels but not be stuck alone somewhere? Is Couchsurfing still a thing? Did you have bad experiences with creeps?
* **Flights:** What's your favorite flight finder?
* **Phone:** Would you get a local sim card for every country you visit (+ 2 weeks) or rely on wifi?
* **Surfing spots:** Any hidden gems in SEA for an intermediate surfer?
* **Medicine**: I have some prescription meds such as asthma sprays and azelaic acid cream. Should i pack enough for like a year or just get them at local pharmacies?
* **Workaway:** Have you done it? How was it?
* **Hiking shoes:** I'm planning on doing some 1-day treks. Are hiking shoes a must or will I do fine with some sturdy sneakers?

itsthelastone,db04fa,Couchsurfing to meet other people?,"I usually stay at hostels when I travel alone so I can meet other people.

But after reading a bunch on Reddit, it seems like a lot of you guys use Couchsurfing to meet people.  I was really confused at first, but then I realized there was a social/events section on Couchsurfing.

So I tried it out on my past two trips and... I really haven't had much luck???  I see so many posts on this sub about success on it!  I tried to go to 4-5 Couchsurfing meets on my past 2 trips (London and Prague) and either 1) only 2 people showed up out of 15, 2) there were no events on it even on a Friday evening.

Hi,

I plan on solo travelling and one of my routes is from Budapest to Sarajevo. The only coaches are from 11am and arrive at 2:30am the following morning. Will I be able to book a hostel that night and check in to it?

I could also get a coach from Mostar which arrives at 11:30pm.

My other option is to get a coach to Mostar, arriving at 6:30am and try and sleep on the coach overnight and then ask the hostel if I can store my stuff there. This is probably the better option, but I'll submit the post anyway incase I can do a 3am check in!

On another note - why is Sarajevo, a capital city, so fucking hard to get to yet Mostar isn't?

BenjiSupertramp,dbgt3b,“I could also get robbed at home.”,"I feel like more and more solo travelers start losing their common sense these days. 

Why do so many people out there trivialize how dangerous some situations and countries can get? 

**“I could also get robbed at home.”**

I have heard this argument a billion times. Last time told by a blonde Norwegian guy in South Africa. 

**”I have been here for 7 days and nothing has happened to me. This country is safe.”**

How do people not even realize that this doesn’t prove a thing? The fact that nothing happens to oneself doesn’t mean that a country is safe, same as something happening doesn’t necessarily mean a country is dangerous. 

**”The locals say it rarely happens.”**

When Couchsurfing abroad a while ago, I asked my host if cars being high jacked really was a thing. He said it rarely happens. It only happens to his aunt, to his brother, to his grandpa and to some of his colleagues at work. In my country hell would break loose if a car had been highjacked at gunpoint. The media would talk about it for days. 

**“The locals say it’s safe.”**

Again. The devil is in the detail. Your semantics might not be theirs. What a Danish person calls “Ghetto” might be different from what a Moroccan person deems as “Ghetto”. 

Young solo backpackers get drunk, stick out like a sore thumb, usually have got a language barrier and tend to get this attitude that everyone will be friendly and welcoming to them. 

Just feel like we should get rid of this attitude of acting like solo traveling is all roses. 

Encouraging people to go out and see the world is a good thing, however, telling people the *arguments* above ends up with lots of them in shitty situations. 

I like to do dangerous things myself once in a while, however, part of it is to acknowledge the situations as they are. 

Last but not least, solo traveling exacerbates most dangerous aspects about traveling. 

What do you think about these arguments above? Ever heard travelers using them before? Maybe used them yourself?",solotravel,1569871621

It's about time for me to do another solo trip (second so far) since my first trip in Costa Rica back in April which turned out to be an absolute blast and gotten amazing traveling recommendations from the community here. Im an extreme last-minute, plan as you go kinda dude as i write this up less than 24 hours from my trip to Thailand lol. I was extremely pumped before but now getting extremely nervous as this will be the longest solo trip ill be doing so far in my life, with not that much planned. I read some similar posts in the past which talk about keeping your schedule flexible.  Main points of this trip is to further push myself out of my comfort zone, get better at connecting with people, get better at planning as you go, and learning more about myself/getting more spiritual. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, i just have few things jotted down for my trip, with no particular order/plan just kind of a get up and go kinda thing. Any of these things actually needed to be planned ahead? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

P.S haven't really jotted anything down for the island so would appreciate some tips to accommodate the above water-based activities!  Let me know if you're traveling also during the same period, and would be open to meet up!

&amp;#x200B;

Activities:

Bangkok:

\- Wat Samphran (lil outside Bangkok)

\- Wat Pho

\- Khlong San Seeb Canal Ferry

\-Chatuchak park and weekend market

\- Grand Palace

\-Wat Bang Phra (thinking about a Sak Yant tattoo)( any better recommendations?) 

\- Bangkok International festival of dance and music

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Chang Mai

\- Elephant Nature Park

\- White water rafting

\- Zip lining

\-Anusarn Market

\- Chang Mai Food festival

&amp;#x200B;

Chang Rai

\- Ajarn Ton (Yak Sant)

\- Wat Rong Suea Ten

\-Wat Rong Khun

\- BaanDam

\-Wat Hyua Pla Kang

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To have some structured questions unlike this structured post i think most  important points are:

&amp;#x200B;

1) With the below activities jotted - any of them you cant really ""wing"" and need to plan in advance?

&amp;#x200B;

2) Best recommendations for a good mix of nightlife/scuba diving/beach/ power sports ( quad, jet ski etc)

I feel very wary of traveling alone due to being a young female and I don’t necessarily want to be alone the whole trip, I have very poor socializing skills when it comes to meeting strangers at public places. 
So I have been thinking of doing one of the adult tour groups, but the idea of being stuck on a bus and doing tours of things I may not find interesting. I also no for a fact I could plan a cheaper trip on my own(I’ve organized trips before). My goal is to possibly do a 4+ week long trip next summer.

Jayhcee,dbl377,"I'm trying to decide on where spending Christmas this year - my options atm are Ukraine, Bosnia, and Budapest - happy to take suggestions","I'm thinking of doing a 5 week trip from Ukraine &gt; Budapest &gt; Bosnia &gt; and maybeee Serbia.

It looks doable and quite cheap to get around with Ryanair, my issue is I don't really know where to spend Christmas. Ukraine looks really appealing to me and I want to check out Kyiv and Lviv, my issue is looking at hostels, there isn't really any standout hostels in Kyiv especially. Despite location being important for spending Christmas, having a good hostel is extra important as I want to feel festive with other people!

...that brings me back to Budapest. The hostels there look extra awesome and it looks very festive at Christmas. My only issue with Hungary and Budapest, and I don't want to sound hipster... is that everyone is seemingly going there these days, the same with Prague. I didn't especially enjoy Prague because I felt like everyone going there was just exploiting it for the cheap hostels &amp; cheap drink. No one was especially interested in exploring Czech culture that much or visiting anywhere else in Czech Republic. And that is the impression I get with Budapest too, I'm not particularly excited to visit it like I am Bosnia and Ukraine which seem really interesting countries and a bit of a challenge. So I'm a bit divided.

I'm also considering Belgrade, but I don't have much knowledge on it.

If you have any recommendations for the region or any hostels, or if you spent Christmas in the region - let me know! I like meeting other travellers, I want somewhere festive, and a country or city that doesn't get swamped with tourists and feels interesting to travel.",solotravel,1569889738

UT_MRU95,dbn7dg,Ireland Itinerary 14-17 days,"Heyo!!  


I am planning my soloish trip to Ireland for August. I plan on flying into and flying out of Dublin. I plan on seeing a friend who lives in Dublin and another who lives in Cork. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I will rent a car I want to make a loop and go north from Dublin and make my way around and the country. Is 2 weeks enough?  I will be renting an automatic transmission it will cost more than the manual and this is my limiting factor in how long I will stay. Most of what I want to do is see the fantastic views and do hikes. I don't really want to get drunk the entire time.    


I will have some camping gear with me as I will be camping during a different leg of my euro trip. I understand that it rains frequently and camping might not be ideal. I am open to sleeping in hostels to meet people. But I am not above pulling the car over and just sleeping. Is this illegal to do in Ireland? I   


I guess what I am not sure about is how to allocate my days. I know most things I want to do. But I don't know how long it takes to do them, if that makes sense. The reason I am having a hard time is that I am from Texas, and it takes forever to drive somewhere and we consider it a day trip( 3hours driving one way). Everything seems like a day trip from Dublin to me.   


2-3 days Dublin ( do a day trip to Glendalough. Check out the prison that James Connolly was executed. Is going to the Guinness brewery worth it? Spend a day catching up with my friend.  Jameson Distillery.  Wicklow Mountains, which I guess could be tied into Glendalough or seen on my way from Cork.  


I want to check out Carrick-a-Rede, Malin head, and Ballymastocker Beach. I am not sure where I should stay during the day(s) I will see this sites. I am also not sure how many days I should dedicate to this area of Ireland.   


Next I want to see the Cliffs of Moher. I am not sure if there is something I am over looking between the northern tip and these cliffs. Should I see something inbetween or can I go straight to the cliffs. Also where would be the best place to make the day trip from to see the cliffs? or can I stay there?  


I want to spend a day or two in Dingle.  


Then afterwards spend 3-4 days? in Killarney. I want to do the Ring of Kerry and spend time in the national park. I want to do various trails. Carrauntoohil is something I would like to spend a day at.  I guess I'd take a day trip to Browhead from here? or should  I do that during my time in Cork?  


Go to Cork to visit my mates and see the natural beauty in that area.

aureole_dust,dbouzu,Help me plan an Eastern European trip mid Oct - early Nov,"I'm traveling in 2 weeks for my second backpacking trip in Europe, this time focusing on Eastern Europe (well Poland).

I'm flying to Stockholm on Oct 15 (booked), staying for a couple days then making my way to Wroclaw, Krakow, and Gdansk. I booked my return flight leaving from Gdansk on Nov. 2.

Here is what I'm thinking -

Stockholm: 10/15 - 10/19 (4 nights / 3.5 days)

Wroclaw: 10/19 - 10/24 (5 nights / 4.5 days)

Krakow: 10/24 - 10/29 (5 nights / 4.5 days)

Gdansk: 10/29 - 11/2 (4 nights / 3.5 days)

Thinking about my last trip, this feels like a pretty generous pace for me, so I'm tempted to squeeze in one more city probably outside of Poland. Good idea? If so, any recommendations? I'm looking at Kyiv, Ukraine (seems to have reasonably priced flights), but still doing some research in terms of safety.

NOSjoker21,dbvdxp,Going to SE Asia the last two weeks in November as a birthday gift to myself. Wondering if all this is possible:,"Title self-explanatory. I have a passport and figured I'd use it more, and after discovering the wonders of Skyscanner and SecretFlying earlier this year, I figure I should go somewhere new.

My flight leaves JFK Monday, Nov 18th at 12:45 A.M. so I'll arrive in Shainghai Pudong forabout five in the morning., and I'll fly out at about 8:00 in the morning to arrive in BKK a little after Tuesday at noon.  I doubt there'll be anything to do at Shanghai at four in the morning, so I'll likely just stay in the airport during that layover.

In Bangkok I want to do:

* Terminal 21 at some point (just to see the hype is about)
* Defintely eat good local cuisine, although I heard the Chinatown is good too (I'm not the kind of person who flies to another country just to eat McDonald's)
* a day cruise from Cat Ba to see the Monkey Island, I've heard good things.
* Hoi An, near the old town tos see some of the national parks (I really dig nature, but I love to see Skylines too)
* I'd like to see the weekend market, the train Night market, etc. I've heard they're a good experience but I should keep my wallet close.
* Sights such as Wat Pak Nam, the temple of Arun, Khaosan road, and I was advised to hit the ""Full Moon Club?""

I figured fi ve - six days would be enough to accomplish all the above, although I'd .like to see historical landmarks too if possib le. However, this is were my trip diverges:

I want to go to Siem Reap to see Angkor Wat. I've always wanted to ever since playing Tomb Raider IV (shut up), however I know that Cambodia whon't be as ""lively"" as Bangkok from what I've been told, however, most of the people in my group chat encouraging me to see Thailand are insisting I should go to Pattaya.

I'm sure Pattaya is great. I'm sure there's things to do in Pattaya that don't involve hoes. But they're encouraging me to imbibe in hoes, despite the fact that I'm not flying across the planet just to get laid. That being said, I don't mind exploring the city if there's interesting things to do there (I was told that Pattaya's a ""resort town"" and I do like beaches), but I absolutely wanted to see Cambodia, though I was told there was less to do there.

Should I give Pattaya a chance or just stick to exploring Cambodia as intended?

For what it's worth, I leave Bangkok the 1st of December (eight hour layover in Shanghai Pudong so I may try to explore a bit while there), and I know train prices/plane prices in the area are cheap bewteen provinces and countries, IU'm just trying to look at my options.",solotravel,1569945309

I'll be going to Switzerland - Geneva, Bern, and Zurich. 

Then heading to Germany - Possibly just to Berlin, but maybe stopping at some halfway point before.

Then finishing up in Belgium and the Netherlands - Maybe just Amsterdam but also maybe Antwerp. 

This trip is over a span of about 2 weeks... in a week.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be doing everything I can to learn the appropriate vocabulary for dining and food allergies, and at the very least writing it down in my notebook so that I can show it to someone if I can't speak it, but I'm wondering what other precautions to take. 

I have celiac, as well as a severe nut allergy, and an allergy to some random seeds. The celiac won't kill me if I mess that up, but the nuts will. I'll be carrying my EpiPen wherever I go as well as antihistamine pills like Benadryl. I'm always very cautious, especially when alone, to avoid things that could be suspicious/risky. I think that eating out locally is probably going to be off the table for me (pun intended).

So I'm looking for advice! How do I not die (from nuts, or starvation)? I'm planning on stocking up on some energy/granola type bars that I know are safe for me. Are there any restaurants/food places in any of these areas that are known for being careful with allergens, having options, or being easy to order from? 

Additionally, is there anything that I should really try to avoid? Like specific liquors or alcohol that have nut additives? Or is there any type of food or dish that would normally be fine anywhere else, but for some reason is made with nut/seed ingredients in any of these countries? For instance, I was surprised to find Linseed as a common ingredient in a lot of foods in the UK. I'm seriously allergic to it, and in the US (where I'm from) it is a really uncommon food ingredient, and mostly found as a component of oil paint! Now it's something that I really have to watch out for when I'm in London!

roxzad,dc5erc,How can I feel like I used to again?,"I'm at the airport after saying goodbye to my  partner, the love of my life. I've never felt like I've left a piece of my heart behind before a solo trip. 

I've always thoroughly enjoyed exploring new places solo, meeting new wonderful people, and simply feeling comfortable doing it by myself. 

I've been with my partner for 2 years and we've grown SO much together that it's pulling at my seams right now that he can't come. I still feel very independent in my relationship and am given space for solo time which I value and appreciate but man.... Why is it so hard this time around? 

This trip I'll be in NZ for 2 weeks flying into Auckland and driving down to Queenstown where I plan to spend a few nights. I booked this a year ago and was so thrilled.

I used to feel like solo travel was always better because you don't need to wait for anyone, you do what you want, and go with your flow. Now, I feel like when I share these moments with my partner they are SO much more enjoyable and meaningful than experiencing it solo. I'm by no means codependent but I f*cking love this human so much.

I guess the reason I'm sharing this is because I'd love a reminder and some reassurance from you wonderful, awesome human beings around why we do this. 

How can I shift my perspective before this trip to really experience it to the fullest potential?

TitanCream,cxjprw,Is a day trip from Seoul to Osaka clever?,"I am in Seoul for seven days in November and, having done my itinerary, I have two days where I can fill in somewhere else. I am considering Busan also, but, I am tempted to do Osaka for one/two days. The plan is to flight out from Seoul on say Thursday morning, very early, explore Osaka that entire day (limited obviously) then fly out late on Friday evening.

I am not sure if this is worth it. The tickets are very cheap and I want to visit Japan but don't want to take an entire trip next year as I will be busier. Maybe I should stick in Seoul or do a Korean day/trip?

stuckbetweenXandZ,cxlrrc,"Transgender and Asian in Asia: Can you share tips, tricks, and solutions?","Hey everyone,

For context: I'm a outgoing, 25yo mixed-race (East Asian/White) trans woman who will be traveling Asia for a couple months (Korea 14 days, Malaysia for 10 days, and Thailand for 14\~16 days). In America, I pass nearly 95% of the time, voice and all, and am seen as an ""attractive cis woman"". This makes some of my concerns lessened, but others more nuanced. Below, I have a couple requests for tips + suggestions for my places of travel, and at the bottom is my main concern.  


1. Any things to note about Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand, specifically as a transgender traveller? 
2. Any all-around, general tips or best practices for travel as a trans woman?

So here's the tea: 

I'll be meeting my partner (cis-man, 28, latin-american) in Bangkok for a couple days. We'll be doing a mix of solo travel and traveling together from that point on. I am an ""Asian-appearing"" (mixed-race) trans woman. While I know not all Asian people look similar, and that I don't look ""Thai"", I am a bit concerned about the mistaken perception that might exist regarding me and my partner. To make it brief: **I feel folks might see us and assume that he had ""purchased"" me**. While I personally see no issue with sex work or escort services, and know that sex tourism is a huge boon to the trans/kathoey community in Thailand, I am worried what this potential mistake in perception might cause. 

Are there certain places where sex workers in Thailand are banned, for example? Or are there certain stigmas associated with it? I'm most concerned about access issues, or issues of safety. I also worry this might make other travelers avoid us, and a huge joy I have when traveling is meeting folks from all over. (Regarding my partner's feelings about this perception: he has no shame regarding this, but he just wants to make sure I feel safe and un-judged when we are   
together)

Thanks for your advice and guidance!

alexs1214,cxmsvx,I have 1 week in November: Should I go to Ecuador or Peru?,"Hi all! I'm trying to decide on a trip this fall. I currently live in Panama and have been to very few countries in Central/South America. After some research, I've been super intrigued by Ecuador and Peru. I will be traveling solo from Panama, have about a week in **early November** (if that makes a difference), and am primarily interested in doing some trekking/nature stuff. Here's what I was thinking for my options:

**Ecuador**: My main interest in Ecuador is going to Cotopaxi park and staying at the Secret Garden hostel. I would fly into Quito and stay 1 night there, then do 3 days and 2 nights in Cotopaxi. All in all, not too pricey a trip. The park looks incredible and I'm in love with the idea of the Secret Garden hostel and all of the activities that can be done there like hikes and horseback riding. I lean towards picking this option, but is Cotopaxi exciting enough to be the focus of my whole trip? Is there anything else I could consider adding for the remaining 2 or so days? 

**Peru**: I'm wayyyy too late/broke to do a whole Inca Trail set up, but I've read a lot about the Salkantay Trek and the Lares Trek. I'm considering heading to Cusco, staying a few days in town to acclimate and signing up for a multi day hike like one of those two. This would be a more serious trekking trip and I don't have a ton of experience with that (though am an athletically fit, so I'm less worried about the strenuous aspect as much as I am about the altitude/needing to purchase a bunch of new clothing/accessories). This would be a more involved trip and more expensive, but also probably worth it to hike in the Andes and see Machu Picchu (even if I don't hike to the sun gate) and other ruins. It looks so incredible. 

So my question is, for a solo traveller with about a week to spare in November, which of these two would you choose and why? Alternatively, if you emphatically feel I should head to a different country, where? I've been to Colombia and Mexico, and from Panama the flights most similar/lower in price to these two would be Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Belize.

Instead of taking weekend trips to places like Chicago, New Orleans, Toronto, Boston, Montreal, etc I think it's better to use my vacation time one day to see all these places. That way, i'll be able to see the city for 3-4 days instead.

I'm going to be travelling through Central &amp; South America from November (from the UK) and whilst I plan to stay roughly a year, I hadn't intended on fixing that with a return ticket home.

With that being said, is there any way around this as I assume it isn't an unusual situation... some thoughts I had:

* Booking a refundable ticket (expensive).
* Booking a dirt cheap ticket from another country in the EU (i.e. France &gt; London for £9). Would this count since I could outline my intention is to travel back through Europe before returning home ?

I explored through 77 towns/cities, stayed overnight in 56 of them, slept in 101 beds and walked more than 3,256 km in 225 days

About me: 27/M/Bangladeshi living in the US. I like reading history, going to historic places, chatting up everyone at the hostel, throwing shapes to electronic music and buying pints I can’t afford for strangers when I’m drunk.

I also kept a spreadsheet throughout my trip for each city (how I know how many km I walked, how many beds I slept in etc etc) so here’s a complete list of the places I visited and how long I was in each of them.

You may notice that I spent a lot of time (36 days) in Krakow. I was working remotely for 6 weeks this summer and needed a place that: 1) I loved 2) was cheap enough for me to rent out an airbnb for a month. Krakow was an easy pick after last summer’s adventures. I also spent a lot of time in Stockholm because I am probably moving there at some point and wanted to get a good feel for the city. Also freakin loved the nightlife and people there, so was hard to leave. Other than the micro-states, the only countries in Europe I didn’t go to were Norway, Switzerland, Belarus and Ukraine. Skipped the first 2 because of how expensive they were and the last 2 for Visa issues.

Last year was my first time visiting mainland Europe, but I also studied abroad in Reykjavik from Dec 2012- June 2013, so had to squeeze Iceland into some of my Top 5 lists

I am planning on writing a blog post summing up these trips with a lot of pictures. I am posting this here first to get a feel of what others would find interesting and would want to know more about. Hit me up with any questions, and I will try to answer them here as well. Here goes the lists :)

# 1 Favorite places for hanging out with locals

1. Poland (Krakow + Warsaw)- Polish young people were super-friendly to me everywhere I went. Literally crossed the border over from Lithuania one time and immediately noticed people were friendlier.
2. Netherlands (Rotterdam + Nijmegen)- Long before I visited the Netherlands, Dutch people were always my favorite fellow travelers for their drunk bike-accident stories and blunt + dark sense of humor. Visiting the country just confirmed that the people living there enjoy laughing at themselves just as much as the travelers I met. I left out Amsterdam because I felt like Dutch people there were a little more closed off to foreigners and (rightfully) sick of dumb tourists for the shit they do
3. Stockholm- Folks can be a little reserved/awkward at first, but nothing a little alcohol doesn’t fix. Mostly progressive, friendly and educated folks.
4. Reykjavik- Similar to the Swedes, just a little more awkward when sober, and wilder when drunk.
5. Belgium (Brussels + Antwerp)- Seemed just as cool as Scandinavia and the Netherlands but didn’t get to spend enough time there to bump it up further

Notable mentions:

* Ljubljana- A lot like Poland, except more socially progressive. It was a lot more fun the first time around, however, because all the universities were on break during my second visit
* Porto- Portugal was a fun place in general. I felt the city structure of Porto just made it easier to meet people compared to Lisbon.
* Albania- Similar to other places in the Balkans, people were exceptionally kind and helped me out when they didn’t have to. I got offered free food everywhere from people who spoke no English!

# 2 Favorite cities for nightlife

1. Krakow- 1 million students in the city and the craziest party city I have been to. Enough said
2. Lisbon- I partied a little too hard here. Even the air felt toxic near the end
3. Stockholm- I have heard it’s different outside of the summer but the party was on 6 nights a week when I was there during May-June
4. Belgrade- Amazing underground music scene + parties every night. Cool dive bars too if you know where to go
5. Budapest- A lot like Krakow. The biggest clubs are bigger but it’s much harder to meet locals here since they seem to have priced them out from the most popular bars

Notable mentions:

* Brussels- Every single night was wild and the stories involve things I can’t mention on a forum. Only city ever where I started a pub crawl and quit halfway to hang out with cool locals I met at a bar
* Reykjavik- People just get bat shit crazy here. They are still celebrating not having prohibition half a century after it ended

# 2 Favorite places for food (I eat meat)

1. Balkans- Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, Slovenia, Croatia- I’m still having Burek withdrawals
2. Italy- Pizzaaaaa
3. London- The city seemed to have a little bit of everything and I dig the chicken shops (classy, I know)
4. Hungary- The local food was bomb (and affordable)
5. German kebab shops- I have tried kebabs in dozens of countries and Germany wins

# 3 Favorite party hostels

1. The Green Studio- Belgrade- My favorite hostel ever. Not a commercial party hostel and the scene depends entirely on the volunteers there at the time. But there were 2 instances when I had to double book a airbnb after paying for this hostel so I could sleep (staff and guests were partying till 9 am one time). Just look at their top 1 star review on Facebook to get an idea of the shit that happens there
2. Little Havana Party Hostel- Krakow- My favorite big hostel in the world
3. The Gspot- Lisbon- Milder version of Little Havana but the volunteers + guests were the best when I was there for NYE 2019
4. The Retox--Budapest- Lived up to the stories. Might have been a bit too much for me tbh. Probably never staying there again but I’ll surely revisit and do shoeys there again.
5. Greg and Tom party hostel- Krakow -Smaller and (possibly crazier) version of their rival, Little Havana. They have the craziest pre-gaming party I have been to in my life. Would have gone back there for more wild pub crawls, but my good friends from Little Havana would have killed me if I “betrayed” them again

Notable mentions:

* The Naughty Squirrel- Riga- pub crawls err night

# 4 Favorite chill, social hostels

1. Green Studio and Lounge- Belgrade-  I understand the irony of calling this both a chill AND a party hostel. But on good nights and the 2nd time I was in Belgrade, this was the chillest place ever. 9 puppies, 3 dogs, 3 cats and volunteers who sing, play the ukulele and drink beer on the sidewalk every night till 4 am. Even if you have no musical talents like me, you can’t help but join in and relax.
2. Oki Doki Hostel- Warsaw- Very cool Polish + international staff with a lot of stuff going on around.
3. Antwerp Backpackers- This little hostel was super cozy. The owner even had his own brewery set up right there and we could get some home-brewed beer.
4. Sunny Lake Hostel- Ohrid- Be ready for beach vibes next to a lake and a chill garden to drink in
5. Hostel One Basilica- Budapest- This one was half party/half chill but still a great place to meet other social people.

Notable mentions:

* City Backpackers- Stockholm- The only social hostel in Stockholm (I tried 5 different ones). Spent too many nights here but it’s just amazing for meeting other solo travelers. Oh and free pasta gets everyone in the kitchen.
* Hostel Mostel- Sofia- there’s a reason it’s so famous
* Whole Wide World hostel- Zagreb- Had the perfect combination of guests and volunteers when I was there

# 5 Favorite places to meet other solo-travelers

1. Belgrade
2. Sarajevo
3. Lisbon
4. The Baltic route- you will find a lot of people traveling solo through the 3 capitals of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania
5. Romania

Note: The trick here is really to avoid any super-touristy places that get over-run with American college students on summer-break, and stag or hen parties from the UK. If hostels mostly consist of big groups that are traveling really fast, it changes the vibe for the whole place

# 6 Favorite techno/electronic music spots

1. Netherlands -all of it
2. Belgrade- the Drug Store (name of a club) has some crazy parties
3. Krakow- Hit up Szpitalna 1 or head to the underground (it’s wayyy in the back) in Prozak 2.0 for some hard-hitting techno in 2nd level basement
4. Stockholm- Trädgården and Slakthuset are probably my 2 favorite clubs in the world
5. Lisbon- There seemed to be a lot going on when I was there. Felt like the place for psy-trance lovers

Notable mention:

* Zagreb- May be it was my lucky weekend but I had 2 amazing parties in 2 nights and the dark Techno scene was on point

**P.S.  I went to Berlin before I was into Techno. This list would probably change if I went back now**

# 7 Favorite Historic Spots

1. Athens- Home to the world’s first democracy\*, and so much more ancient, cool stuff.
2. Auschwitz- One of the more moving places I have ever been to. Ended up going there 3 times
3. Rome + Florence- The mecca for anyone fascinated with the Renaissance and Ancient history
4. Sarajevo- The devastating history of this place hit me harder than I anticipated. The walking tours were pretty intense too because the guides remembered the stories themselves.
5. Berlin- A place with a lot of important modern history, right up to when the wall fell

Notable mentions:

* Paris and Munich- hard to skip either if you like history
* Tirana- Albania doesn’t get much historical recognition but some crazy stuff went down here not too long ago

# 8 Favorite spots for Nature

1. Iceland- At least 5 different spots in Iceland are among the 10 prettiest places I have seen in my life
2. Lake Bohinj- Slovenian Alps- Amazing and not a lot of people either if you go early in the summer
3. French Riviera- Broke my budget but the views made it worth it
4. Transylvania- The name translates to the “land beyond the woods” so you get the picture
5. Adriatic (Croatian/ Montenegrin) coast

Notable mention:

* Bosnian countryside near Sarajevo- really caught me by surprise because of how unexpectedly pretty it was

# 9 Favorite picturesque towns/cities

1. Cinque Terre, Italy- There’s a reason the cruise ships pile up here
2. Sintra, Portugal- Looks like something straight out of medieval movie
3. Dubrovnik ,Croatia- King’s Landing
4. Gozo, Malta- Europe or Africa?
5. Ljubljana, Slovenia- That famous architect did a good job

Notable mentions:

* Krakow- talk about a romantic city
* Tosa de Mar (Spain)- you have to catch a sunset there. Make sure you get the bus times right from Barcelona
* Brasov- prettiest part of Transylvania I visited

# 10 Best bang-for-your-buck spots

1. Krakow- You can buy beers for a euro in the city center. Bania luka is open till 5 am
2. Warsaw- Like Krakow but slightly less cheap
3. Sarajevo- Just as cheap as Krakow but not as cool. Still pretty cool though
4. Belgrade- Slightly more expensive than Sarajevo. 1.5 euro pljeskavicas are must-haves if you eat meat
5. Budapest- Way too cheap for being the former (twin) capital of an empire

Notable mentions:

* Porto, Lisbon- See some of the coolest places in Western Europe on a budget
* Malta- Really pretty and really cheap, and somewhat different from the rest of Europe

# 11 Awesome places that caught me off guard

1. Slovenia- Probably the most underrated country in Europe.  I’m kinda glad no one is talking about this, so it’s not getting ruined
2. Christiania- Copenhagen- One of the chillest places I have been to yet
3. Sarajevo- There’s the historic significance of it, and then there’s the natural beauty of the valley
4. Warsaw- Not sure why no one ever told me Warsaw people are cool af. It’s also a proper big city with a lot going on
5. Dresden- Little town with a lot of history. Do the night tour if you make it there to find out about how the city dealt with the end of communism in very interesting ways

Notable mentions:

* Hamburg- Cool big city that no one talks about for some reason
* Brussels- Wasn’t expecting it to be this much fun

# 12 Places I haven’t been to that I want to visit some day

1. Bergen, Norway
2. Swiss Alps
3. Southern Spain (hopefully after I learn some Spanish- the language barrier was real)
4. Croatian islands
5. Southern Italy

# 13 Places I want to go back to the most

1. Greece- My next Euro trip will probably just be a month or so in this place so I can fit in all the trips to historical spots that 12-year-old me wanted to see
2. Stockholm- Never had a bad day there so would not mind going back.
3. Poland (Warsaw + Krakow)- Some of the friendliest people I have met and the prices don’t hurt
4. Berlin- Only makes sense now that I live for Techno
5. Munich- Seemed like a cool city that I definitely didn’t see enough of

Notable mentions:

* Ljubljana and Slovenia in general
* Netherlands- Anywhere but Amsterdam because Dutch people are awesome and the techno is great

# 14 Favorite stretches during the trip (in no particular order)

* **Green Studio in Belgrade-2018**\-  Came across the chillest hostel ever in Belgrade with 10 volunteers , 10 guests and a bunch of animals. Ended up becoming close friends with the guests and volunteers, and following some of the volunteers on their travels to Ada Bojana (Montenegro), Ohrid, Skopje and eventually London.p.s - Went back again this summer to reconnect with old friends, and of course made some really good new ones too.
* **Little Havana Party Hostel in Krakow**\- The best large party hostel ever. Extended my stay 3 times the first time I was there and was sad for a week after I left. Had to come back to reconnect with the place this summer. The best part about Little Havana is that if you don’t like the current guests, you can just walk across the street to Bania Luka and meet awesome Polish students to party with
* **New Year’s Eve 2019 in Lisbon with the crew from the G-spot hostel**\- There was a group of 7 of us (mostly Aussies) that met at the hostel and were inseparable for a week around NYE. Went to my first psy-trance festival ever with these guys
* **World cup finals and semifinals in Paris-** I was following the World Cup winners around Europe and inevitably ended up in Paris for the last week. On my first day I met a group of people from a Couchsurfing meetup and ended up hanging with them till 4 am and drinking beers by the canals. That group just got bigger and bigger for the next 6 nights and culminated in the World Cup celebrations
* **Felix and the French guys-** I was doing my usual late night head-count to see who wanted to join in my search for the best Techno party in Zagreb. Met these guys chilling outside the hostel and we were in sync immediately. We left the rest of the group and went to a party where the vibe couldn’t have been any better. Got back in the morning, and all of us got kicked out of bed a few hours later (we slept past checkout time). After recovering for the day, we ended up going to the same hostel in Ljubljana where we raged again for the next 3 days. We were together for less than a week but really felt like I was part of an old friend group there

Notable mention:

* **Traveling with the same people through 5 cities in the Baltics**\- Almost everyone in the Baltics goes through the same route- Estonia, Latvia, Vilnius, Warsaw (and sometimes Krakow). There were at least 20 of us (solo-travelers and groups combined) that kept turning up to the same hostel at the same time in every city. At first accidentally, but after Vilnius, we essentially started planning out our hostels together in the next cities.

# 15 (some of the) Most interesting stories of the trip

* **Getting stranded on the Albania-Kosovo border:**

I tried taking an evening bus from Tirana to Pristina. Got booted from the bus and stranded at the Kosovo border without any cash (spent it all in Albania preparation for a new country), a sim-card or wifi. Either the border police or I misunderstood their visa exemption laws. After 30 mins of failed hitchhiking attempts, found a taxi driver who spoke enough German/English to get me to a nearby tiny Albanian town with an ATM and cheap-ish hotel for the night. Went out to see what’s up in town and found bars populated with depressed 50-something men and every young person I met tried to sell me weed.  A pleasant Albanian man from the hotel invited me for a drink, and went on to tell me all about how he just got back the day before from being in a LA prison for 6 months for trying to illegally immigrate with a fake passport. Apparently he spent $3000 on food and ""good California weed"" in prison but couldn't get his hands on booze while there. The next morning, I lost my wallet while looking for a bus to get out of town. Had it returned to my hotel with all my cards and ID(s) intact by a kind man who found it on the streets (the whole town apparently knew there was a foreigner staying at my hotel). Realized 5 mins before my bus left that the kind man had (probably) taken my 15 euros in cash from the wallet, so sprinted to an ATM to get enough cash for the bus ticket and managed to catch it

* **Sleeping in a Berlin park and waking up in a movie set:**

Missed a 3 am bus from Berlin to Copenhagen because I partied too hard in the evening. After finding out the next bus was 24 hours later and my hostel (and the hostels around) were fully booked, I snuck into the hostel smoking room to sleep. Cleaning stuff woke me up and kicked me out at 8 am when they found me there. A volunteer told me to try sleeping at a park so went tod do that. 1 hour into my nap, I woke up to people yelling. I was in the middle of a triangle consisting of two professional cameramen on their big camera-machines facing a couple sitting on a bench. They were filming a movie and the director started yelling “kein photos” when I tried to Snapachat it. Successfully argued that I should get to record stuff since I was there first, and left

* **Accidentally going to a BDSM Techno party and then running into an old friend:**

On a weekend in Stockholm, I met 4 local guys outside a club (Trädgården) after it closed at 3 am. We wanted to keep partying so went to another place, which turned out to be a boat party where cougars go to pick up younger guys. When that closed at 5 am, a couple outside told us to go with them to a rave in Solna (pretty far). We took a taxi there, and on the way, she did mention the word BDSM once or twice but we thought it was a joke. Walked into this venue to realize it’s a gay sauna with everyone in leather thongs and dudes walking other dudes on leashes. The 4 locals were freaking out for a minute but then we collectively decided that we’ll stay till the party ends since we already paid 20 euros for it. The Techno was good so I was making the most of it on the dance floor. Noticed someone kept looking at me in the dark as I was dancing around. Eventually she came over and was like “what the f are you doing here?”. It was my good friend, Frida, who I had met at my hostel in Guadalajara last year and partied with a bunch there.She had just flown into Stockholm 12 hours prior to that. After getting over the initial shock, we just kept on partying.

* **Samoan MMA fighter taking down a bouncer in Budapest:**

It was my first night in Budapest in 2018 and I traveled there from Slovenia with an American friend I met in Cinque Terre. We went out with a small group from my hostel. The guy leading was this cheerful Kiwi dude who had jokes and was making us drink a lot on the way to the bars (he bought a bottle of Jack on the way and almost single handedly finished it in 40 minutes and made us do swigs). He was built like a Samoan tank. He told us he ran MMA in New Zealand/Australia and he definitely looked the part. Also mentioned how he is connected with the mafia in Budapest. We didn’t really worry because he was very friendly to us.  My friend and I forgot his name, so to this day we just refer to him as “The Rock”. At the first bar we tried, the bouncer didn’t wanna let us in. The Rock got pissed and tried to attack the bouncer and all of us had to restrain him. Honestly looked like the bouncer was scared. We went to another bar and he was calm and happy again. Many beers later, a couple of us (including The Rock) went to the bathroom. Some Swedish guy said something to my other friend as a joke, and the Rock got pissed because apparently the Swedish guy disrespected us. 30 seconds later, he knocked out the Swedish dude with one punch. A crowd gathered and a bouncer tried to go after the Rock. It was a blur, but in 5 seconds the bouncer was also almost knocked out. A bunch of bouncers came to help. They surrounded him but everyone was afraid to go in as The Rock kept asking them to go for it. Eventually the police showed up and broke it up. At that time, my friend and I bailed because we didn’t want to get involved in this shit.

* **Latvia racist attacks:**

Riga was an interesting place. A lot of Eastern European countries are notorious for having a re-emergence of  racist/xenophobic movements. But you don’t usually (or at least I didn’t) encounter any issues when you’re in the fancy touristy parts of these countries. Riga was an exception to that rule. All 3 nights I went out, I encountered problematic people. The 1st night, I came across some guys who were trying to pick on me at the bar for no reason. I cannot be sure but I suspect it was racially motivated (I’m South Asian and somewhat dark-skinned). On the 3rd night, I came across a drunk group of skin-heads who got pissed because I said cheers in Latvian and not Russian. But for both of these instances, I had Latvian strangers emerge at the scene who had my back. This made sense in the context of what I heard later from a local: that tensions are  apparently still high in the country between groups who speak Latvian and people of Russian heritage who think Latvia belongs to Russia. The dust doesn’t seem to have quite settled in this post-USSR country.

But back to the story. On my 2nd night night, first I was attacked on the dance floor of a bar by a drunk skinhead. He was pushing me only for seeming to be at that location, so I got free and just went to the other side of the bar (it was huge). An hour or so later, two more drunk skinheads came up to me and told me I need to leave Latvia. Followed was a conversation of “why?”s that went something along the lines of:

Them: Get out of Latvia

Me: Why?

Them: because you’re black (I’m brown ftr)

Me: Why is that a problem?

Them: Because we are Russians. We are Nazis

Me: What does this have to do with being Russian?

Them: We don’t know

I was pretty drunk to so I kept asking questions for like 5 minutes till they themselves were confused as to why they were mad at a tourist helping their economy. Eventually one of them just went “you have to leave”, grabbed me and went for a gut punch. He was super drunk, and I had 10 seconds to brace for it so he didn’t really connect hard (felt like he didn’t want to connect hard for some reason). I stepped back, wished them a good day and walked off looking for any other bar that was open

1. Do I need a specific drivers license to ride throughout all of these countries, do certain licenses permit me from entering some countries. What would be the easiest one to get?
2. Would I have to pay for parking fees for motorcycles? If so, what countries in particular?

mrichter2,cy3h3x,How to convince helicopter parents to let you solo travel,"Hey! I'm 20F, from the US, and am in love with the concept of solo travelling. I've done it domestically a few times, with more trips planned for the next few months. I have my first ""solo"" international trip coming up, I'm going to Frankfurt in November! 

However, I'm staying with a family friend while there, and likely will spend a majority of my time with her, so it's really not ""solo"". This was the only way I could convince my helicopter parents to let me go. 

My parents are great, don't get me wrong. They're just SUPER PARANOID and think solo travelling is the worst thing a girl could do. And unfortunately, they still pay for most everything for me (school + housing at school, insurance, gas when I'm at home). I appreciate them and all that they do. But they've made it abundantly clear that I ""Can't"" go out of the country on my own. I wanted to do Vienna when I found a great deal. They shot that down. Then Barcelona. 

And I travel ON MY OWN MONEY. I work a lot and save so that I can travel. I just can't really afford to piss them off because like I said, they still do a lot for me. And when i graduate after this year, I'll be back under their roof to save money. Which stinks. But that's life. Has anyone else been in this situation? 

I feel confident that I can travel solo and be fine. They're fine with domestic (for the most part), but the minute I mention international, they're like, ""oh go stay with so and so in ____ country so we can know you're safe"" or ""oh, Sweden?! You'll be shot!"" Or ""no. It's not safe for you to go alone, you can't afford it."" Or even ""get a friend to go with you."" But the point is, I WANT to do it alone! I'm one of the few who likes solitary travel a lot, so I want to go alone. But they don't seem to get that. Any advice?!

Tl;dr : my parents are very helicopter-y. But they can afford to be (?) because they still support me a lot, financially. However, I want to and can afford to travel with my own money. How can I convince them it's safe and I won't die etc?",solotravel,1567298779

Alternatively I can adjust my first few days to get proper beach time. 

I’m not one for diving as ocean life freaks me out but maybe will venture into the water briefly with a snorkel. Although the idea of sea snakes and stone fish terrifies me. 

I am more interested in the actual culture of Bali and would like to plan a trip to see some villages, like the one where they harvest salt and especially the one where they make gamelan gongs. 

So I think it is smarter to spend some time either in Lovina or Amed, but am worried about finding a driver to take me to the various villages. Also I am worried that I’ll quickly get bored on my own in such a laid back and quiet place.

My main question is: as a born and bred California girl who has never seen *real winter*, where should I go and where should I avoid over this time period? 

I am ok with chilliness and rain, maybe a bit of snow, but I really can’t afford an entirely new wardrobe just for a snowy freezing winter.

I’ll also be in Europe over Christmas (woo! and also my first Christmas away from home) and I’d love to spend it somewhere atmospheric.",solotravel,1567331809

lottallamas,cy94fc,Solo female traveler and a little shaken up after an encounter at my hostel,"I’m traveling by myself and decided to stay at a party hostel for the last few nights of my trip. It was a great time up until this morning. 

Our dorm room just had me and two guys in it. They seemed nice enough last night when I met them. I was chatting with one of them this morning, laying on my bed and messing around on my phone, when he gets up and climbs into my bed with me. I just froze up for a second because I was so shocked and he apparently took that as me being ok with it, because he pulled me towards him and tried to cuddle. 

I told him to fuck off and tried to get up, but he just wrapped his arms around me and wouldn’t let go. He laughed like I was overreacting even though I’m fucking terrified at this point and pinned down by some man I don’t know. 

He didn’t get up until I said I had a boyfriend, which is really messed up, but I was just so relieved he let go that I basically sprinted from the room. This was a few hours ago and he’s checked out of the hostel now, so there’s really nothing else to do about it, but I’m still shaken up after the whole thing. I haven’t stayed in many hostels before and I never expected my dorm mates to act like that. Idk what to do at this point but I really don’t want to sleep in another room full of guys.",solotravel,1567339400

positive_nursing,cya4wo,A cautionary tale from my experience at a London bar,"I went out to a bar last night with a few girls I met at my hostel. The night was going great! We went to a bar with a downstairs club, a lively atmosphere and dim lighting. Two of the girls went to the restroom and I hung out nearby to wait for them. A girl approached me and asked if I would watch her drink while she went in to the restroom herself. I thought nothing of if, said sure, and placed her drink on a counter near me, within eye sight while I continued dancing. 

Little did I know she was out of her mind.

She came back from the bathroom after my friends had already returned, and I grabbed her drink and handed it to her. She immediately got in my face and began accusing me of shipping drugs into her drink. I assured her I did not, but she relented. She said she saw me and two other guys each “rub our fingers together above her drink” and now she demands I pay £7 for the drink. I said there is no way in hell thats happening. She then demanded I take a drink of her drink to prove it’s not roofied. I initially refused but after 5 minutes of arguing I said fine and took a big drink. Then she was mad about that and said she wouldn’t drink after me. I felt completely lost. I asked her, why would she leave her drink with me, a complete stranger, if she was so concerned with getting roofied. She then stormed off. 

About 10 minutes later after laughing off the experience with my friends, security approached me, took me to a back room, told me the girl had said I tried to drug her and they needed to search me. This was fine with me, and after a search and a 15 minute conversation with security I was allowed to return to my night and friends on the dance floor. 

The whole situation has sat horribly bitter on my palate. Thankfully the security guards were nice and understanding, but the fact that someone could have such a cognitive dissonance and move that to an accusation boggles my mind. It’s not hard to imagine how that could have gone horribly for me and put me in into the back of a police car. All over a nice act. 

Never again will I watch someone’s drink that I do not know. I hate that this situation has hardened me to a degree and left me as suspicious of others as this girl was. Really rotten way to end a good night.",solotravel,1567345662

Day 1 I didn't get out of bed much. Now it's Day 5 now and I'm just starting to feel better. So basically a week has been stripped from my vacation and I can't tell you how upset I would have been had I known this prior to this trip. A fucking week of PTO and travel funds gone for this bullshit?

I had so much fun the first two weeks perhaps it caught up to me... Not sure... Maybe just too many nights out.

Anyway so here I am in Seoul wanting to do all of these yours and shit but I feel like ass and can't walk more than a few hundred feet without being completely out of breathe ( I mean I'm not in tip top shape but damn I can run a couple of miles without stopping).

So... What do I do? I realize that I'm in the gaming capital of the world and head off to a PC Bang. A PC bang is basically a gaming cafe in Korea where you can order food and shit and play any games you want. Absolute blast honestly. I went to one of the most famous ones which is where the league of legends championship was held this year. (Insane stadium).

Maybe many of you aren't into gaming - but I love it as a side hobby some days after work to play a game of two or something stupid. In the last few days even though I've felt like shit I've just medded myself up and played for 10 hours plus rather than waste away in the hotel room.

I know. I know... The tours would have been better but hey.  I made the best of a shitty situation and honestly looking bad I've really enjoyed myself. I know this type of thing doesn't exist anywhere - but next time you're sick in another country.. try to think of things that maybe you could do. Obviously if it was extremely bad I would have been bed ridden... But I felt good enough to at least sit up and game .

Even though, I will leave within a week for a week, I have nothing planned to prepare and to do yet. Although it's a good opportunity to get out of my comfort zone, I don't really know what I'm going to do on my own. It is also silly to stay in the hotel room all the time.

It will almost definitely be somewhere in the Caribbean or Latin America (since those places are all cheap and easy to get to) but I definitely need some help deciding!

The countries I'm looking at are:

I've realized my mistake, I keep searching for ""travel destinations"", but that's not what I want. I don't want to go to Munich/Berlin/Amsterdam or poor little 800-residents-1 million-tourists-a-year Hallstatt. I don't want to see the ""best dining/drinking/sight-seeing/partying"" etc. places. 


I just want to go to random towns and join someone for a BBQ, hang out at a campground by the lake &amp; hop on a boat with someone, check out the county fair with like 4 rides and 100 people, do fun things like hay rides. I want my travels to be like an American roadtrip where you pull over for whatever random towns show up on the highway, instead of trying to hit New York/LA/Austin/etc.


You pick up on what little things are happening in a town when you live there, but do any of you have tips/experiences for how to find out about small-town events when you're roaming, and how to find people to hang out with for a day? I honestly haven't even been successful with doing social things like this here in homeland America and I'm not sure how to go about it. I've had a handful of outings to rivers and campgrounds with family friends, but I don't know how to proactively search for this myself. 


Small volunteering for a day or two would be cool, but I've decided I'm not ready for multiple weeks-long volunteer work like WWOOFing/workaway. For now I'd rather work on my laptop/ipad for half the day, then roam the other half. 


I'm also only thinking about travelling Europe-ish right now, I know that travelling to other countries where you're richer than the locals adds a whole other layer of safety issues and politics to ""wanting an authentic cultural experience"" that I'm nowhere near prepared for. 


The quickest answer is ""Just rent a car and let google maps take you wherever you want"", which I'll probably do! But I wanted to ask here if anyone has personal experience and success with this kind of roaming, and if you have any tips on social skills. Feel free to share any travel memories you have too!

beeknees7,ckgzku,Solo trip to Berlin (my first time travelling alone!),"I'm an 18 y/o student from America and I took my first solo trip this spring. This semester I studied in Italy, and about 4 days before spring break started I had no plans and no one to travel with, so I booked a very last minute trip to Berlin, a city I've always wanted to go to (thank you budget airlines!) and stayed for 4 days. Other than going to Italy with the other students, I had never travelled to another country, so I was super nervous about travelling in two countries I was unfamiliar with. I also had a shoestring budget so there was no room for error, and I'm generally a very anxious person so between my dorms and the hostel I was staying in I was so nervous something would go wrong. 

I just want to say I LOVED Berlin. But so many things went wrong! I missed my train from the airport, got stuck in freezing sleet, ran out of phone data, and brought the wrong train ticket which resulted in a 60 euro fine (which demolished my food budget), booked my hostel for the wrong dates by accident, and got really really sick the first morning. Panic after panic, I wanted to go back to my dorm and my friends, and I started regretting even coming at all. But everyone I talked to at the hostel and train station were super polite and understanding, a woman in my hostel room brought me water, and I decided I would try to make the most out of the rest of my stay. 

Thankfully, I ended up doing almost all the activities on my bucket list. I actually really liked the freedom to do whatever I wanted by myself since I didn't have to organize plans or do something I didn't want to. I went to six museums and spent hours in each, filled up my memory card on my camera, and got to practice some of my German skills. In the end, I definitely do not regret going alone, and I think the most stressful part of me is the actual travel to get to my destination. But there's so much else I want to see there and would not be adverse to going alone again, but I would love to go with friends and be able to share the experience with someone.",solotravel,1564619742
TravelerInTime1986,ckhr2z,8 Days In December - Where?,"I love traveling to Europe in December and it looks like I’m going to get another chance this year the week before Christmas. I’m loosely thinking Amsterdam, and maybe Berlin. I am not sure if it’s worth doing two cities in that time span. 

So I start thinking that sounds like a cool trip, and then I start thinking about other places I haven’t been and want to go... Budapest, Barcelona. And here I sit, in this vicious circle of indecisiveness.

I’ve been to France, Italy, Switzerland and the UK. And I love them all and am tempted to go back, but I feel it’s best to try something new.

I’m a male in my early 30’s, love history, food, and nightlife. Especially WW2 history. I also enjoy Christmas markets. Not particularly concerned with cost, and would be staying in hotels.

Could maybe add one more night on if it made sense but really looking to spend about 7 nights in EU.

Looking for recommendations please! Thank you in advance.",solotravel,1564623754
ThoughItWasADrought,ckhw6q,Stick to Italy and France or throw in Switzerland?,"My first time solo traveling and going to Europe - very excited but nervous that I'm putting too much on my plate. I'm flying into Rome in mid August and flying out of Paris at the end - exactly 14 days of travel time. I've dreamed about going to Rome and Paris since I was a kid and I know I have enough activities planned there for the 10 days. I'm a big art guy so I know I'll probably spend an entire day in The Louvre, ha. 

However, what do I do for the other 4 days? I would love to visit another place and have considered Nice and/or Florence but I'm also quite intrigued by Interlaken and Gimmelwald (the Mountain Hostel is what dreams look like they're made out of), pretty much just the idea of Switzerland. 

Going into Switzerland will obviously be a pit stop, but I'm just nervous that I'm rushing myself into an entirely new culture and atmosphere, especially knowing I'm someone who likes to let stuff like that marinate. I'm not running a marathon here. But if I were to go to Switzerland, I would love to be in the alps or someone semi-isolated where I can enjoy a beer and read Tropic of Cancer. Is it feasible to go to Switzerland? If so, where should I go if I'm leaving from Rome?

_________________________________________

**FIRST DAY**

So, after arriving in the GIG airport, I went directly outside and got myself a RioCard. If you plan on using public transportation like I did, you absolutely must have one of those. You can use it to pay for buses, metros, VLT, boats, etc. After getting mine, I paid 18 BRL for an Airport Shuttle that left me in General Osorio Square, in Ipanema (regular buses are like 4 BRL). From there I walked to my hostel, left all my stuff there, changed my clothes into something more comfortable (flip flops, shorts, got my sunscreen on) and my adventure started.

This is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, but do not underestimate how hot Rio de Janeiro can get, it was more than 30 degrees Celcius most of the days I was there. But there was some kind of fog hovering above the city for the whole period I stayed, some cariocas told me it is normal in winter.

[Here's what Ipanema Beach looked like that morning](https://imgur.com/a/F2BJ4A3). Those pictures were taken almost at lunch time, if I remember correctly.

After that, I ate some Pasteis de Nata (known in Brazil as Pasteis de Belem), which is some kind of portuguese food, in a little pastry shop in Copacabana. After that, I took an extremely cheap Uber and went to a place called Mureta da Urca - it's some kind of sea-side balcony where you can order some super cold beer, sit and watch the sunset with the view of a lot of little boats peacefully resting in the ocean.

[Here's what the sunset looked like in this spot](https://imgur.com/a/4aA9F83). Hey, look, it's Jesus! I got my beers for 10 brazilian reais in a place called Urca Grill. When I went in to pee, I realized they serve brazilian food in a pay-per-weight manner, so I went and made myself this a beautiful dish. I went there a lot of times during my stay, the food was delicious. [Here's what my food looked like, price included in BRL](https://imgur.com/a/EXvOI6U).

**SECOND DAY**

That day I had two things planned: to explore the Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas surroundings and to have a very typical carioca lunch in a restaurant called Esquimó, in downtown Rio. The lagoon (Lagoa) was really close to my hostel. If you're planning to go there, please don't be an idiot like me - wear sneakers, not flip flops. Flip flops will fuck you up, specially if you try to explore the Catacumba Park, which has some pretty nice views of the Lagoa. The Lagoa itself was a really cool place to walk, run, walk your dog or your kids, and maybe have a picnic on the least weird-smelling areas. Some specific points of the lake were really smelly, but it was mostly alright. [Here are some photos of the Lagoa. Unfortunately, the visibility wasn't that great due to the fog I mentioned earlier](https://imgur.com/a/BlrJqqA). Hey, look, it's Jesus again! I think the perimeter of the whole thing is like 8 km. I walked around it twice and then I rented a bike for 10 BRL per hour and went around it a few times by bike, it was really fun, the weather was very nice (there are cheaper alternatives for renting a bike but those involve an app of a local brazilian bank, so I didn't really bother).

Then I took the metro and I went to have lunch at the Esquimó restaurant. That place is the tits. You pay 23 BRL and choose one kind of meat, four things to go with it (I decided to go full on brazilian and asked for rice, beans, broccoli and guava flour). They also bring you a drink of your choice and a little pudding as dessert. All that for 23 reais, no questions asked. You ask for your meal, and twenty seconds later (seriously), I mountain of food appears before you. Rio is truly a magical place. The food was delicious, and it was way too generous, there wasn't any room left for the dessert when I finished. The drink (a yerba mate tea) was  served in a tiny glass and I honstly drank it hoping it wouldn't kill me with diarrhea later. It didn't, it was all good. [Here's my esquimó lunch](https://imgur.com/a/tbVyYAM). After that, I went and sit on a bench outside the restaurant for like 30 minutes because I couldn't even walk after all that food. It was glorious. After that, I went back to my hostel, changed and went to Ipanema beach again. It was a good day. (The food at Urca Grill is much better, by the way, but I went to Esquimó because I was told it was a classic brazilian restaurant in Rio).

**THIRD DAY**

In the morning, I walked from Ipanema to the end of Leblon, to the Two Brothers Mountain (Morro dois Irmãos in portuguese). It's a place you can climb by foot, lots of shades from the trees and beautiful nature. I thought it was going to feel dangerous and shady, but it absolutely didn't, and I wasn't the only one up there, I saw and talked to several people on the way, most of them also tourists. The views were amazing, [as you can see here.](https://imgur.com/a/N5A5mRX)

After that, I went to see Christ the Redeemer. You can't go to Rio de Janeiro without climbing the Corcovado Mountain and getting real close to the son of the original G, right? So there I went. I bought tickets for the Christ the Redeemer on the internet. There are three ways you can visit the monument: by walking (you have to be seriously in shape for this, and probably use a lot of insect repellent), by minivans that pick you up in some specific spots of Rio, or by the little train. I chose the train because there wasn't space on the vans anymore (the price it's 80 BRL for both the train or the minivans, and if you decide to walk, you have to pay 25 BRL). The train ride was cool enough, but mostly uneventful. It has some beautiful views occasionally. If you go by train, sit facing opposite of the train's direction for a better view, and when coming down, sit as you normally would. Once up there, you get an AMAZING view of the whole city. I went there at 3 PM and stayed until the sunset. I had a beer up there and bought a little mug, because hey, I'm a tourist. It's a bit crowded up there, obviously, but with a little bit of patience, you can take your selfie with Jesus and take some really beautiful pictures of the whole city from up there (and you can see Niteroi from there, too). Beers are not too expensive up there, the souvenirs are. [Here are some of the photos I took up there.](https://imgur.com/a/sDhPi73)

**FOURTH AND FIFTH DAY**

On the fourth day, I went to walk at the Lagoa again, then I walked the whole Ipanema beach one more time. I had one of the sweetest moments of my trip in the beach, that morning: some guys started playing some really nice bossa-nova right in front of the Tom Jobim statue. Three guys playing jazzy relaxing music, the ocean right there behind them, making that soothing sound... jeez, I think I shed a tear or two. I filmed them but unfortunately, the audio is kinda messed up, so I won't post it. After that, I had lunch (Urca Grill again) and then I went to a place called Marina da Glória, which is a pier with a lot of boats that you can book rides on (in advance, of course). I made a reservation via TripAdvisor on a tour called ""Open Sunset Sailing Tour"" for 225 BRL. Guys. That was the most amazing part of my trip. The boat ride had free caipirinhas, snacks and the guides were very knowledgeable and spoke good english. We took a 3 hour long boat trip around Rio region, starting with the Guanabara Bay, then going near the Sugar Loaf (which I didn't climb, maybe next time), then we stopped near a quiet beach for diving and waiting for the sun to set. The views were spectacular, it was one of the greatest things I've done in my life. Worth every penny. If you get the chance to do it, DO IT, it's unbelieavable. The weather was great, too. [Here are the photos of my last two days in Rio.](https://imgur.com/a/H4p7qUV)

_____________________________________________

**FINAL REMARKS**

The first thing I'd like to say is: the cariocas are the coolest people on the planet. Never before I felt so welcomed anywhere as I did there. If you can speak a little portuguese you will feel like a superstar, everybody will want to talk to you (Uber drivers, people at the hostels, people you meet around). I spent an hour talking to the room maid of my hostel while I rested in the last day, also at lot of people everywhere just started random, happy conversations with me. I'm not usually the kind of person who likes to talk to random people in the street, but I truly feel like Rio kinda changed that a bit. Holy shit, the people are so happy! They give off this amazing energy, it's unbelieavable.

Secondly, I'm really glad I did this, and I want to thank you guys all for the inspiration for planning and going on a solo trip. It was an incredible experience!

Another important thing: although I mostly stayed in the south zone, which is generally regarded as safe, I felt safe everywhere, including centro and when taking the metro back from Glória to Ipanema, by night. Also, I used metro a lot and I also took a bus in the Largo do Machado region, and I never felt unsafe. But of course, always mind your surroundings.

If you are there, try to have some legitimate brazilian food. I mostly ate at Urca Grill, which is cheap, delicious and if the sunset is coming, you might as well just grab a beer and sit on the balcony outside to wait for it.

Of all the places I went, this is the first time that I actually didn't want to ever leave. I will miss you, Rio de Janeiro.",solotravel,1564670765

After that, I went to see Christ the Redeemer. You can't go to Rio de Janeiro without climbing the Corcovado Mountain and getting real close to the son of the original G, right? So there I went. I bought tickets for the Christ the Redeemer on the internet. There are three ways you can visit the monument: by walking (you have to be seriously in shape for this, and probably use a lot of insect repellent), by minivans that pick you up in some specific spots of Rio, or by the little train. I chose the train because there wasn't space on the vans anymore (the price it's 80 BRL for both the train or the minivans, and if you decide to walk, you have to pay 25 BRL). The train ride was cool enough, but mostly uneventful. It has some beautiful views occasionally. If you go by train, sit facing opposite of the train's direction for a better view, and when coming down, sit as you normally would. Once up there, you get an AMAZING view of the whole city. I went there at 3 PM and stayed until the sunset. I had a beer up there and bought a little mug, because hey, I'm a tourist. It's a bit crowded up there, obviously, but with a little bit of patience, you can take your selfie with Jesus and take some really beautiful pictures of the whole city from up there (and you can see Niteroi from there, too). Beers are not too expensive up there, the souvenirs are. [Here are some of the photos I took up there.](https://imgur.com/a/sDhPi73)

**FOURTH AND FIFTH DAY**

On the fourth day, I went to walk at the Lagoa again, then I walked the whole Ipanema beach one more time. I had one of the sweetest moments of my trip in the beach, that morning: some guys started playing some really nice bossa-nova right in front of the Tom Jobim statue. Three guys playing jazzy relaxing music, the ocean right there behind them, making that soothing sound... jeez, I think I shed a tear or two. I filmed them but unfortunately, the audio is kinda messed up, so I won't post it. After that, I had lunch (Urca Grill again) and then I went to a place called Marina da Glória, which is a pier with a lot of boats that you can book rides on (in advance, of course). I made a reservation via TripAdvisor on a tour called ""Open Sunset Sailing Tour"" for 225 BRL. Guys. That was the most amazing part of my trip. The boat ride had free caipirinhas, snacks and the guides were very knowledgeable and spoke good english. We took a 3 hour long boat trip around Rio region, starting with the Guanabara Bay, then going near the Sugar Loaf (which I didn't climb, maybe next time), then we stopped near a quiet beach for diving and waiting for the sun to set. The views were spectacular, it was one of the greatest things I've done in my life. Worth every penny. If you get the chance to do it, DO IT, it's unbelieavable. The weather was great, too. [Here are the photos of my last two days in Rio.](https://imgur.com/a/H4p7qUV)

_____________________________________________

**FINAL REMARKS**

The first thing I'd like to say is: the cariocas are the coolest people on the planet. Never before I felt so welcomed anywhere as I did there. If you can speak a little portuguese you will feel like a superstar, everybody will want to talk to you (Uber drivers, people at the hostels, people you meet around). I spent an hour talking to the room maid of my hostel while I rested in the last day, also at lot of people everywhere just started random, happy conversations with me. I'm not usually the kind of person who likes to talk to random people in the street, but I truly feel like Rio kinda changed that a bit. Holy shit, the people are so happy! They give off this amazing energy, it's unbelieavable.

Secondly, I'm really glad I did this, and I want to thank you guys all for the inspiration for planning and going on a solo trip. It was an incredible experience!

Another important thing: although I mostly stayed in the south zone, which is generally regarded as safe, I felt safe everywhere, including centro and when taking the metro back from Glória to Ipanema, by night. Also, I used metro a lot and I also took a bus in the Largo do Machado region, and I never felt unsafe. But of course, always mind your surroundings.

If you are there, try to have some legitimate brazilian food. I mostly ate at Urca Grill, which is cheap, delicious and if the sunset is coming, you might as well just grab a beer and sit on the balcony outside to wait for it.

Of all the places I went, this is the first time that I actually didn't want to ever leave. I will miss you, Rio de Janeiro.",solotravel,1564671401

\- Lived in NYC &amp; Boston so I'm used to the hustle and bustle of big city life.

**Some questions I have.**

\- What is the best and cheapest way to get around London?

* Spain
* Italy
* Germany
* Australia
* New Zealand
* Tahiti
* Mexico
* Bermuda
* Bahamas 
* Turks &amp; Caicos
* Greece
* Nicaragua
* Japan (younger) 

**Length** 20 days give or take

**Budget**  Somewhere around $5000, I have enough points for airfare. I like nice hotels, but am just as happy in a hut on the beach. Open to a retreat as well. 

**Interests**

* Outdoors: Certified to SCUBA. Enjoying natural resource &amp; experiencing nature and wildlife, sitting on a beach or getting pampered at a spa. Id like this trip to be a balance of experiencing new and exciting places but also finding stillness.
* Culture: Seeing spiritual temples and spaces, music, museums, historic places and cultures different than your own. Yoga and Meditation are a big draw. 

**Safety**  Im 32 and have my wits about me but i'm still only 5""2 and 100 pounds soaking wet so safety of course is to be considered.

I will have a friend in the area, but will likely venture off solo for a while, as he's there for *party* reasons primarily, and I kind of want to get around.

I'm not sure what people really do when they travel... haha. I usually travel for music festivals or for work. I'm not terribly interested in western culture, so I don't know what to do when I'm out there (history/museums don't sound too interesting, but I do enjoy sites/views, technology and music). I want to try and do more solo traveling in the future, so I figured this would be a good opportunity to try to experience a partial solo trip.

I've booked hotels already, but I'd be willing to cancel a day or two and try out a hostel. I've never stayed at a hostel before, as I always previously assumed they were... run down, cheap and unsafe places for people to stay at [and do cocaine], or something?

As the title says - landed my dream job two days ago and have a gap of a month or so between finishing my masters and starting work. I’ve realised now is probably the last time I’ll have as much free time in my life (very sad), so thought I’d celebrate with a little solo trip. I’ve travelled solo many times before, having recently spent 3 months in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia doing fieldwork so pretty confident alone! I’ve planned out three routes, and basically need someone to help me decide which sounds best. All of them are approximately 10 days.

Trip 1: Kosovo, Macedonia and Albania (Pristina, Peja, Prizren) (Skopje, Ohrid) (Tirana, Shkoder). 

Trip 2: Georgia and Armenia
(Kutaisi, Tbillsi, Yerevan) (Stopping in Bratislava for a night as it’s cheaper to get back to the U.K. this way than directly, plus never been)

Trip 3: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania 
(Tallin, Tartu) (Riga, Daugavpils) (Kaunas, Vilnius) (and maybe a trip to Minsk if I can sort a visa)

Trip 4: Ukraine and Moldova
(Kiev, Chisinau, Lviv)

Which one would you take and why? Budgeting about £800 for it but worked out it’ll be significantly less. I have a few ideas of places I want to see in each place, but would love to see where people recommend and why!

1. How much more expensive is the high season really? Multiple sources vaguely state that the high season is ""significantly"" more expensive. Is this just hotels? Does this also apply for hostels, bus tickets and restaurants?
2. The Vale do Pati trail in Chapada Diamantina comes highly recommend. How much should I realistically expect to pay for a guided trek for 4/5 days? I'd preferably team up with other hikers. The prices I've been able to find are from the websites of guide agencies and from my experience those tend to be highly inflated in comparison than booking on the spot.
3. Same question as above really; how much should I expect to pay for a 3-4 day guided tour in the Pantanal? 
4. Can anyone share their experiences visiting Pantanal during the wet season?
5. Nature wise, Chapada Diamantina, Lencois Maranheses, Foz do Iguacu and Pantanal seem to be the most recommended parks to visit. Which other other (national) parks would you recommend to visit if you are specifically looking for (multi day) hikes or tours?

Without hesitation, I scanned the cheapest flights immediately after waking up, and got a round trip for $460 from Newark.

I have never been this excited in my life, and I know I will not regret it.
What advice do you traveling vets reccomend me to do while I'm there? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",solotravel,1564754981
Tiverty,cl4vw7,Your ideal hostel bed?,"If I see something like this when planning, it's almost an insta-book for me. Since the hostel is a crash pad for me, the bed comes first and atmosphere second.

* Outlets available in the bed space.
* Shelf and a small lockable cubbyhole storage; inside the bed space.
* Ability to ""close"" the bed area via a sliding panel or curtain.

joyapco,cl53kr,Japan Trip for Last Week of July 2019 with JR Pass,"July 24 - Osaka

1. Arrive at night (just check in hotel)

July 25 - Himeji, Kobe &amp; Osaka

1. Claim and activate JR Pass
2. Visit Himeji Castle via Shinkansen
3. Enjoy Kobe Beef for lunch
4. Explore Kobe Harborland, Meriken Park, and Motomachi Chinatown (have visited other Kobe sites in previous trips)
5. Participate in Tenjin Matsuri
6. ~~Proceed to Hiroshima via Shinkansen~~ Get injured and be forced to stay in Osaka for the night to treat wounds; thank god for really knowledgeable drug store employees. Will be in pain and stiff from scraped and swollen knees for the rest of the trip.

July 26 - Hiroshima (Miyajima Island)

1. Proceed to Hiroshima via Shinkansen early, and check in hotel early
2. Visit Miyajima for half day (easy to go to with JR Pass, which covers the train trip to the pier and then the ferry to Miyajima island). Did NOT proceed to Mount Misen, since it still requires 30 mins of hiking even from the top cable car station, which is not good for my stiff, swollen knees.

July 27 - Okunoshima Island &amp; Hiroshima

1. Morning visit to Okunoshima Island aka Rabbit Island. Not that much to explore, since they blocked off most of the paths towards the middle of the island, so I could only explore the outer parts. Took round trip direct ferry to Okunoshima Island from Mihara station (JR Station), which is available only on limited days. Please research before going here.
2. Afternoon personal tour of Hiroshima
3. Transfer to Nagoya via Shinkansen
4. Find out from hotel reception at Nagoya that the World Cosplay Summit 2019, which was supposed to be held in Nagoya from late July to early August, will NOT be held in Nagoya until August. July parts of summit will be held in TOKYO.

July 28 - Tokyo

1. Early morning transfer to Tokyo via Shinkansen
2. Go to World Cosplay Summit at Tokyo Dome
3. Short visit and souvenir gathering in various Tokyo destinations, including Shinjuku, Shibuya, Akihabara, and Tokyo Station.
4. Transfer back to Nagoya via Shinkansen

July 29 - Takayama &amp; Shirakawa-go

1. 8:43 AM train to Takayama via Shinkansen (2 to 2.5 hours trip one way)
2. Catch next Nohi bus to Shirakawa-go (1 hour trip one way). Bought round trip ticket. You can refer to bus trips between Takayama and Shirakawa-go in this link: [https://www.nouhibus.co.jp/route\_bus/takayama-shirakawago-line-en/](https://www.nouhibus.co.jp/route_bus/takayama-shirakawago-line-en/)
3. Had Broiled Hida Beef set meal for lunch at Irori restaurant. Was disappointed.
4. Round trip shuttle to observatory at top of hill. 10 mins one way via shuttle, but would take 30 mins one way if by foot. Shuttle departs every 20 mins: (00,20,40) from bottom, and (10,30,50) from top.
5. Explore rest of Shirakawa-go, including Heritage Museum
6. Catch 3:15 PM bus back to Takayama
7. Have Hida Beef steak samples at Maruaki restaurant (recommended by tourist information). Got 6400 yen for 3 steak samples weighing 300 grams total (was good enough for 2-3 people if with rice IMO, but I finished it)
8. Explore as much of Takayama as I can 
9. Encountered heavy rain. Got umbrella from a convenience store. 
10. Catch 6:47 PM Shinkansen back to Nagoya
11. SPECIAL NOTE: Next time, just join the Takayama - Shirakawa-go tour from Nagoya. It's only a difference of 2000 yen (a lot more if you didn't have JR Pass), plus you save a lot more time and effort.

July 30 - Nagoya

1. Acquired 1-Day Shoryudo Pass for foreigners: good for all transports within Nagoya, including subways, buses, sightseeing buses, but NOT JR RAILWAYS (got JR Pass for that anyway).
2. Sites visited: Toyota Commemorative Museum, Noritake Garden (NOT WORTH IT), Nagoya Castle, Tokugawa Garden, Osu Kannon Temple &amp; Osu Shopping Street, Oasis 21.
3. Transfer back to Osaka via Shinkansen.

July 31 - Universal Studios Japan (Osaka)

1. Ride train to Universal City Station from Osaka Station's Platform 1
2. Tackle the very limited seasonal rides / events available
3. Head back to hotel to pick up bags
4. Head to airport

Notes to self:

1. Always get hotels closest to the main stations next time
2. Keep a gallery album on smartphone of all trip essentials: passport copy, flight booking, hotel bookings, tour bookings, travel insurance, reservations, etc.",solotravel,1564757392

I was browsing around on Kayak earlier, and found great tickets to go to Bangkok, in Thailand and also Hanoi, in Vietnam.

I’ll be going in the middle of this August, first to Bangkok for 2 weeks and then Hanoi for 2 weeks!  My budget is around $40 USD a day.

Only thing is, this is my first time traveling alone!! I plan to stay in hostels for my whole vacation.

Do you have any recommendations for first time solo travelers like me?

I'm new to both solo traveling and this subreddit and would really love some advice! I have been scouranging the subreddit for my topic as well, but I felt my case is a little different and would love some people's thoughts. I will be traveling to France from 9/23-10/2. I've been to Paris for a few days, so would love to explore the other cities!

&amp;#x200B;

A few cities I was thinking of going to: Paris --&gt; Lyon --&gt; Aix-en-Provence (or Avignon?) --&gt; Marseilles --&gt; Paris

\^ For context, I have taken some French classes in preparation for this trip. NOT saying I am amazing yet, but I am hoping I can get by with it

&amp;#x200B;

Interests (greatest to least): 

* Cultural sights + walking around and enjoying the view
* Any kind of fun local activities (I saw a lavender field? Is that worth it?)
* Farm-to-fork food and casual food (e.g. REALLY excited to visit and shop around the marketplaces! And you bet I'm going to be searching for the best baguette)
* Learning more about the French language!
* Maybe some nature, but nothing too strenuous 

&amp;#x200B;

My questions:

* Any other cities you have been to that you would recommend? Similarly, any cities I have mentioned that you would not recommend?
* How much time would you recommend staying in each city? 
* What mode of transportation is available? (train, car, ride-sharing someone told me about blablacar?)
* Hostels? Airbnb? How do you make friends? 
* ANY recommendation/tips that you'd like to share! :)

adityachaudhri,clfm0g,Question: Lebanon: Do I stay in Beirut throughout and take day trips everywhere or do I move to different places when traveling?,"Hi everyone! 

I'd asked a question earlier about choosing between Oman and Qatar for a week, I got some great responses and figured that Oman would be best - turn of events though - I ended up booking myself to Lebanon instead!! (the flights were only slightly more expensive than Oman (but the visa was cheaper haha) and I recently learned to drive so maybe I'd do Oman when I'm more confident behind the wheel)

I've been looking at Lebanon itineraries and have found that every place is fairly close and accessible. 

I'm going for \~9 days and intend to see Beirut, Jeita Grotto, Baalbek, Byblos, Tyre, Qadisha Valley and maybe even Tripoli (undecided on the last one) 

So, my question: **is it better to stay in Beirut and just take day trips to these places since everything is at most 3 hours away or should I actually move about in terms of accommodation?** (say from Lebanon to Tyre and do southern day trips, or Lebanon to Tripoli and do north day trips?)

I've done about \~17 countries solo but I'm a little scared going to Lebanon because of the region's social/political turbulence. I read that Beirut is the most developed tourism wise while other places have fewer (but cheaper) options so wandering about by myself in cities with less of a tourist/hospitality network if that puts me at risk is also something I'm considering while making this decision.

I will have **52 days** in total. I plan to fly in to Beijing and leave afterwards from HK. I don't plan on taking any domestic flights, so trains will be my main choice of transportation because they're cheap and fast in China. I have my itinerary now almost together. **The two only things I'm not sure yet are:**

**- Are the number of days at each destination appropriate?**

- Should I add either **Nanjing** (between Huangshan and Xi'An) or **Chongqing** (between Chengdu and Zhangjiajie) to my itinerary? Both cities are on-route and would be convenient to make a stop there for a few days.
