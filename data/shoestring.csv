eqdesu,rk5xo1,Planning a Long Stay Trip To The UK (Ready to buy my ticket!),"Hello, I've been wanting to go to the UK since before COVID and now that things are (seemingly. omicron ughhh) calming down, I'm ready to buy my ticket!

&amp;#x200B;

This post is a hope to get a second opinion on how to plan out finances and other details, as I've never done this kind of thing before. (Its definitely calling to me. I don't want to wait until I'm too old!)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I have so far:

&amp;#x200B;

England only allows tourists to stay 6 months max (you have to get an extension after 3 months, which I hear isn't too hard.), so I plan to stay as long as I can! 

I plan to leave as soon as May 1st.

The area I will be in is NE UK (Lincolnshire area), so not as expensive (hopefully) as London.

My budget is currently around $10,000 or, roughly, £7,314. It's what I have lined up to earn so far before I leave but am looking to increase this budget with the time I have left.

I plan to use SpareRoom to locate a room to rent. my eye is on a room currently that is £400/month (\~$3,178.38 for 6 months). I can't lock spaces down in advance unfortunately so this will change. 

For flight there, I've only been shopping for one way tickets using Google's old ITA Matrix (hasn't failed me so far!) I see various flights from WestJet and JetBlue that interest me at around, including bags and potential train rides from London airports to Lincolnshire, \~$1000-$1200.

The rest of the money (roughly $5.5k) is for food and living. 

&amp;#x200B;

Few More Details - 

I have some friends that won't be too far away so I'd like to be close to them, hence the location. I don't mind moving around the country, but I'm really laid back and aren't really looking to be too ""touristy"". 

I'm assuming public transport, biking, and (occasional) rides from said friends will be my main form of transport.

I would love to make my way to Europe after this (more on that another time) as I am told I would be allowed to work in certain countries as apposed to England where they don't allow you to work on a tourist visa. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things I'm Not Sure How To Address -

Not sure what I should be doing with my money to prepare for the exchanges.

I've gone over the visitor list on the UK government website, but still want to triple check from anyone with experience on if there is anything else I should be doing to prepare my visit. 

Any other details I may be missing from lack of experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys could help me out, I'd really appreciate it. It's been a long and sad journey for me and I just want to finally chase something I feel would make me happy, just by accomplishing it. Please excuse any ignorance I might have here, I'm here to cover all of my bases before I buy the plane ticket.

Thank you in advance!",Shoestring,1639948469

Far_Future_Feature,rvbhkm,San Francisco - cheap food options and study spaces. Will have kitchen access at a hostel.,"I'm staying at a hostel sort of between the Embarcadero and Montgomery stations (Pacific Tradewinds) in downtown San Francisco. 

Any recommendations for food? I love carbs like buns (e.g. will stop by Good Mong Kok Bakery), noodles, and especially dumplings. I also like fried carbs, like fried  chicken at Aria Korean. I will also be able to do some cooking and will probably buy/bring some noodles. 

I'm also looking for coffee shops that will let me stay for 1-2 hours to  get some work done. I heard Starbucks lets people stay. Any other places  you would recommend? Bonus, if there's access to bathrooms during  covid19!

Ideally, we will spend the first half of the week in a more ""modest"" accommodation setting and then perhaps change to a more ""beach hotel"" accommodation. 

This is going to be an expensive ass trip because I will be paying for most of it but I told her it won't be ""luxury"". (Mostly  I want to show her that she can travel the world on a budget and that finances shouldn't get in the way of a cheap trip). 

I've travelled extensively throughout the Caribbean but I've never been to Jamaica. (White) Americans insist that Jamaica is one of the less ""desirable"" and ""dangerous"" islands due to the poverty.

MrHavx,ryoi5a,"Just finished planning a cheap ski trip to Canada for one week, and i have some things i would like to share.","So myself and two of my friends decided that we wanted to go on an international ski trip, and after research on the best destinations we settled on Banff, Alberta. Now before i continue, i want to mention that we all own a ski pass called the IKON pass, which ranges in price from $700-$1000. But with the pass comes varying perks such as partner hotels, discounts at ski resorts, and of course access to ski lifts at 50+ partner resorts.

Beginning with the flight, we were able to find flights through a Canadian airline called Westjet. In my experience visiting Canada, (this would be my third time) their airlines are cheaper than US carriers. The price of the flight was $160 including tax. On top of that, we all have bags full of ski gear which count as a checked luggage, costing $60 a piece, bringing the individual price to $220.

Next we needed to book a hotel in Banff, and acquire transporation from the nearest major airport, located in Calgary 90 miles or 144km away. This was where the IKON pass made things so much cheaper. We were able to get a discount on a bundle including the hotel and a shuttle directly from Calgary to Banff for $354 each. Normally the bus (Brewster Express) is $150 round trip and the bundle price + IKON discount brought it down to $109. Ill also add that we wont be needing a car in Banff, they have an amazing public transportation system for less than $2 a ride, and free busses to the ski resorts.

The hotel was $654 for 5 nights, or $130 a night. Our room isnt too fancy, it has a balcony, a mini kitchen, bathroom, large tv, 2 twin beds and one queen. Split between the three of us, makes it $218 per person. 

So far our total cost individually is flight ($220) + lodging/transportation($354). Bringing me at $574.

Now that the basics are out of the way, we also factored in we’ll be needing to cook/buy food. Our hotel has a kitchenette, with a stove, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, and a sink. For 5 nights this should be plenty and theres tons of easy meals to make like pasta or even simple turkey sandwiches. 

Nonetheless, we are assuming a daily food budget of $25. Some food will be cooked at home and some days we will go into a town for a meal. Total cost $125 each. Which for 3 people splitting on groceries should cover it.

Now of course this is a very personalized experience and not everyone is willing to forego luxuries such as a car or dining out everyday. But if you are a skiier/snowboarder that wants to visit a world class destination on a budget, it can be done.

My friends and I are going to stay in Calgary for two more nights after we leave Banff, we rented an Airbnb in downtown for $258 or $86 each. Our total cost at this point is $785. I imagine we would likely excede $1000, but for an entire week in Canada, I think we did pretty good! Let me know what you think or if you have any tips or suggestions.",Shoestring,1641607344

**Location**
I’d like to ideally travel to a different country, but I’m not opposed to staying in the US (maybe somewhere out west). Some places we’ve both said we’d love to visit one day: Mexico, Africa(not egypt), Northern Europe, or any Asian country.  

**Length**
We’re gonna take 8 days off, but we don’t have to spend all of those on vacation(we will if we can afford it though). So i’d say length 4-8 days. 

**Activities** 
We like outdoor activities such as hiking. We’re also fine just chilling in our hotel/airbnb/whatever and hanging out, going to restaurants. We’re not really party people but we’d probably visit a bar or two. Any unique activities to get experience of local culture would be amazing. 

**Price**
Now since i’ve never traveled I have no clue how much everything costs.  But here is where I ask you guys: Out of the locations mentioned above, which one(s) has the best combination of price and things to do during March? The cheaper the better here, to an extent. We don’t wanna go so cheap that we’re staying in an unsafe or dirty place, but we also don’t need any luxuries.

user051107,qw5wjm,US- NZ Cheap Cities/Transport Tips Pleas and Thank You :)," 

**Hello all,**

**I will start this post with a bit of context then get on to the questions so skip to the bottom if you want first..**

!! Context:

I am 18 years old male from the Uk will be 19 during travels - travelled a bit before but never solo.. I only speak English.. Open to any suggestions and will travel with just a large rucksack that classes as hand luggage will travel the US with a budget between £500-£750 not including inbound or outbound flights and £500 max per island for at least 1 weeks travel not including inbound and outbound flights.. (Don't know what of that is useful or needed but there you go)..

From starting sometime between august and september 2022 i will have a 30 day Visa to travel the US in which i hope to start somewhere on the east coast and for the sake of this we will say NYC... After the 30th day i plan to volunteer in Fiji for a couple months and travel their for a bit then visit either Tonga or Samoa for a small period of time then be in New Zealand around the New Years mark latest (a couple weeks early is fine as have some family over there but meeting UK family around New Years).

At the moment the only cities across America i want to visit are Denver, San Francisco and landmarks are Yosemite National Park and The Grand Canyon - open to anywhere else.

The volunteering in Fiji is in Suva so will need to make my way there/ travel near there.

Tonga/Samoa still undecided (can only afford one though) - open to anywhere within either country.

New Zealand have family in Tauranga and plan to do quick tour with UK family of South Island - open to any other suggestions for either island i might do some solo travelling before or after anyway.

I am open to given anything a go - i am travelling on a budget so good value, cheap or free recommendations please.

For transport i do not have a driver's license so will need to rely on plain, train, bus, boat or even hitchhike (plus any others i haven't mentioned that do not require me having a license of some sort).

I have done some research on visas and looked at average flight costs and stuff/ looked at more how much it will cost but not into specifics so before i do one last cost up/plan before i actually start booking and making things official looking for other people's'' past experiences, recommendations and opinions.

!! Related Questions:

Which cities in the US do you recommend me going to with good transport links to other states/ rest of country?

What transport method do you recommend i take and or any recommendations of companies i should or shouldn't use?

What reasons can you give me to pick Samoa or Tonga over the other/ any good or bad things about travelling to either nation?

Which cities/islands in any of Fiji/Tonga/Samoa do you recommend i go to with good transport links to main islands that have the international airports?

!! Unrelated Questions:

Are there any good non main street flight/ transport comparison sights that you recommend?

!!Conclusion

Thank you for reading this far.. if you have any other tips/advice that might be somewhat relevant/useful in terms of saving me money while travelling feel free to submit them as a comment.

Hope you're all doing well.

I am a 19 year old student at a university in Milan and plan to travel across Europe for as long as my budget can last in July 2022. I have a budget of €2000 for the first month of travelling and another €1000 which I will only be able to receive the next month if I choose to continue travelling. I want to visit Spain, Portugal, Germany, Netherlands, Czech Republic, France, Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia, and Poland whilst not staying in a city for more than 3 days. I'll be staying in hostels and at friend's houses in Debrecen, Hungary and Prague. I don't eat much hahah so like 1 cheap meal per day. I won't have any suitcases, just a backpack. I already have the European vaccine pass so corona shouldn't be a barrier. I'd be willing to switch out the more expensive countries for cheaper ones as long as they're in the EU.

How should I go about with traveling? Are buses the way to go or should I be getting an Interrail pass for 1 month since I'll likely be visiting many cities?

Are there cheaper alternatives to hostels?

Is this feasible or am I dreaming? 

Would it also be possible to fit in Austria, Denmark, Greece, and Belgium?

Is there anything else I should know?

Heck with laundry one only needs to check the weather and backpack. The only limitor here is flights (and school sometimes)

&amp;#x200B;

\--The Question--

**Where would you go to look for cheap flights if you are fixed on the depart/arrive locations but are very flexible in time?** 

For instance going from DC to Atlanta when there is a 3+ day weekend (which is quite often) or school holidays? Down for book well in advance or last minute flights, airport changes just aren't generally an option. 

I don't have too much experience beyond just googling 'cheap flights \[route\]' and hoping the calendar is enough. I am definitely not aware of much other tricks beyond top google search booking sites i sometimes will peek through.

Any great hostels to stay at? Any great restaurants/street food? Any places not listed that you’d recommend? Any other general info?

All advice is much appreciated.

doodlebobx2,qkgvde,Honeymoon trip to France!,"Hi! My fiancé and I are planning to take a honeymoon trip to the southern coast of France in September 2022. We pushed the dates to September (wedding is in June) to hopefully miss a little bit of tourist season/get better deals on flights. We want to go for 2 weeks, and right now the best price I’m seeing is ~$680 round trip from ATL to Nice, France. Does anyone know of a site to check what prices this route has been in the past? Would it be advantageous to fly into a different part of France (like Paris) and take a train or bus to the coast? 

We are not sure yet how many different places we want to stay on the coast, so if anyone has done a similar trip and has an itinerary or suggestions on unique and affordable activities, please let me know!!  Right now I just keep researching places around Nice. Not sure if I should book all of our accommodations in advance or just take care of the first few nights.

Main reason here is just for quiet and to relax. So indoor housing where it's not noisy and away from any busy traffic.

brecks101,pws6ec,World packers - volunteering for what benefit?,"Hey, 
 
I was just looking at ways to save money whilst travelling Europe and found worldpackers.

Just wanted peoples thoughts on worldpackers, basically they have opportunities for people to volunteer in return they get free accommodation and sometimes food. I was looking at Budapest and just wanted what peoples thoughts are on this most of them working 25/30 hours in a hostel getting free accommodation in a shared dorm but only getting one meal. 

So basically for 30 hours a week labour your not even getting 3 meals, I've looked at Woofing and it seems you work around the same hours but get all your meals paid for. 

I guess you are saving like 10/20 quid per day on hostel costs but working most of them 5 days to have 2 off just seems a bit of a rip off?

What's your thoughts are some hosts better than others maybe? What's the benefit of this? Maybe make friends with other volunteers?

Thanks,
Was just a thought anyway",Shoestring,1632781496

I'm trying to book an anniversary trip with my SO to Las Vegas at Vdara for November and trying to keep my costs as low as possible.

I haven't booked anything yet, still shopping around for a good price. I found a rate on Hopper that would save me at least $100 (even after joining M Life Rewards).

- bus to Brno (2h30m), stay 2-3 days 
- possibly Vienna for one day? (1hr33m bus) trying to keep this one short for $$ reasons
- Train from Vienna to Budapest (2h15m), stay here ~ 5-6 days 
- fly to Valencia (~6hrs), stay here around 5 days maybe (this one seems pretty expensive)
- fly to Porto (~5hrs), stay here around 4 days
- bus/ride share to Lisbon (3h30m), stay here around 4 days. Planning a day trip to Sintra while we’re here. Fly out of Lisbon back home

snailderail,q2fcho,"Car camped in Aspen, CO to save me $200+ per night","My brothers were backpacking and needed a driver to get them into an area and pick them up (that was my job). I realized quickly how expensive the Aspen area was BUT I was able to enjoy myself on a shoestring budget:

First, BATHROOMS: I checked out where primo bathroom areas were located, like outdoor malls and villages, groceries, even port-a-potty options and found out a wide range of them. Most places closed at 8PM, so be prepared. Some places also offered showers for the outdoor folks that are travelling through.

Second, VISITOR CENTERS: Aspen hires golden staff to help you with the towns and events. I realized Aspen had a huge history of mining, the arts and prehistoric fossils. I was able to listen to a philharmonic concert for free, an organ concert for free, panned for gold in nearby creeks, day hiked to fossil sites, window shop the expensive plazas AND get some great photos along the way while finding local eateries as I explored the city.

Third, CAR CAMP: I was shocked to see the a good group of the low-wage, low-income staff that catered to us  at these expensive malls and villages actually slept and lived out of their cars in the parking lots. I asked about this to staff members and it's allowed, as long as you're not disturbing others and keeping to yourself. Many of the staff are ski bums who love the weather and live a shoestring, part-time job lifestyle. Many also had dogs and access to electricity. They were living good.

For me, I used my truck, I brought along two pillows, a towel for the floorboard, a blanket and a face cover to block out any light (many parking lots have bright lights and when the sun rises, it can be harsh coming through the glass). I set the towel below my feet to keep my toes from getting dirty from the floorboard, I put one pillow on my lap while another behind my head, and wrapped myself in a blanket. If you park near a coffee shop you can get wifi but many places around the city had regular cell towers so service wasn't an issue. You can basically park anywhere, including the forest, BUT parking near villages helps kept the jitters at bay AND you never know when you need to use the restroom...

I also put my sun shade up for privacy and I backed in to parking spots so I can easily leave. No police came by, no security teams checked on me.

Third, FOOD from GROCERS: Don't waste your money on restaurants, instead get your food from marketplaces. They'll have premade meals and all your needs fairly cheap compared to restaurants. Just keep an eye on your intake, some food is unsettling and if it hits you in the middle of the night, you may be stuck looking for a restroom.

Fourth, NOBODY KNOWS YOU: I realized thousands of people came and went through this town daily, so the best way to blend in, don't wear fancy clothes, wear casual, dress waaay down and blend in with the locals. Not making myself look like a tourist really let the guard down on many locals I chatted with, including great hole in the wall eateries and free events. Be kind, be nice and let the locals talk. More importantly, be a good listener. You're the visitor and that's their home. Explore respectfully.

I had a real blast and I spent less than $200 total and I really spoiled myself with a few restaurants and access to some museums. Had I got a hotel, it would have destroyed my budget. I looked at it this way: however much money I spent I subtracted that from $200 per night to determine my savings. All together, four nights x $200 is $800 - $200 spent total = $600 saved. Not bad! My brothers came back safely and I was able to give them the grand tour of what I discovered. What an awesome way to end the hike.

&amp;#x200B;

Tips: Go to the visitor centers. Check out hours of operations for any establishments. Be nice to the locals. Enjoy the outdoors!

emcro,q4nfmz,Maximizing cash back and points with credit cards for free/cheap travel using CardPointers,"Hi all, I'm the indie developer of the [CardPointers app](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1472875808?pt=285054&amp;ct=homepage&amp;mt=8) which I shared with this awesome sub about 1.5 years ago, and I thought I'd share an update as I've added a lot of new features with ya'll in mind in the latest version. If you don't yet use the app, here's a quick summary:

* Maximize the points and cash back on everyday spend just by using the right card -- add your cards by name (NO bank logins) and the app will sort all of your cards based on their bonus multipliers across 18 different categories, and hundreds of subcategories. Over 4,000 cards and 800 different banks are supported in the U.S., Canada, UK, and many other countries.
* Track all of the recurring monthly/annual credits that a lot of credit cards have these days.
* Add and track Amex, Chase, and other offers, so you'll never let a good one expire again thanks to automatic reminders and integration throughout the app and maximize your savings.
* Apple is currently featuring the app in the **Great Apps for iOS 15** and **Must-Have Safari Extensions** lists (I'm still pinching myself for that, feels surreal!)

&amp;#x200B;

And here's what's been added in the latest version:

* **Safari Extension**: automatically show you which of your cards you should use on 1,000s of e-commerce sites while you shop to maximize your category rewards and any offers you have available.
* **Safari Extension** superpower: activate and sync EVERY Amex and Chase offer at once (no more tapping 100 times to add all the Amex Offers!) and they'll show up immediately in the app, and the shopping part of the extension mentioned above.
* **Location Reminders**: save the location of your favorite stores, then the app will automatically notify you when you're next there, with the details of your best card.
* **Smart Lists**: set up search criteria and be notified as soon as new offers become available on Amex, Chase, Citi, and Bank of America, so that you can add them to your card before anyone else.
* **Every region in the world is now supported**, with hundreds of new cards added to the most-requested countries: Canada, UK, and Australia. If your card is missing, you can now Add a New Card right in the app and customize it fully.
* Rewrite of the Apple Watch app which now supports swipe actions throughout, independent location reminders, full offer details (and snoozing), and lots more.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're not an Apple user, there are still some new goodies for you:

* Standalone version of the extension which allows you to bulk-add and sync your Amex Offers and is 100% free called CardPointers X and available from the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cardpointers-x/hlambnnbnnjkabpgemeompijpdliimkm). More of the Safari Extension features will be integrated into the Chrome version in the next month.
* My next big focus for 2021 is wrapping up the new native Android version of the app, you can [sign up for the official waitlist](https://cardpointers.com/android/) and be the first to know about it when it's ready. In the meantime I continue to support the original version of the app as a [PWA](https://cardpointers.com/app/) which is 100% free for all users and is built with Material Design and looks &amp; works great on Android and has the card recommendation feature.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything I do is built privacy-first:

* Financial, browser, and location data are the most private imaginable, and my focus has always been to put your privacy and security first. There is \*no\* browser history or location data that ever leaves your device, everything is processed within the app/extension itself.
* I do not collect ANY financial data, and especially not any bank logins, as no app actually needs it to help you earn more from your cards.

&amp;#x200B;

The app is a free download, and every feature from the original version of the app continues to be 100% free, for new and existing users. Some of the new features are only available to Pro members available via in-app purchase.

I'd love to have you check out the app and get your feedback, speaking with users has helped shape the app to what it is today, and I'm all about helping everyone maximize the many opportunities to save money and earn more points by leveraging their credit cards' benefits.

KresblainTheMagician,pccrb1,Need some help with this itinerary (Costa Rican vacay),"I am planning a surprise vacation for my wife for next January to Uvita, Costa Rica. Here are the details so far:  


**Arrival**  
We arrive in San Jose, Costa Rica at 11pm  
I was looking at renting a car from Sixt since they seemed pretty trustworthy, but the latest I can schedule a pick-up after hours would be 11:30pm and I am not sure if that is enough time to off-board, pickup luggage, and get to the companies location for pick-up despite them being located in the airport (from what google tells me anyways). 

Since we arrive so late, I plan on staying the night in San Jose at any hotel I can find that's close/cheap (this is not my priority atm)

On day 2 (the day after arrival) we will leave that morning and drive down the coast to our Airbnb in Uvita stopping at towns along the way; this looks to be roughly a 5-6 hour long drive which is fine. Days 2-9 will be spent on day trips &amp; exploring/relaxing at our airbnb.   


**Departure**  
Our flight leaves San Jose at 1am on day 10, so I will only be booking the Airbnb until day 9, checking out at 11am and driving up to San Jose again and spending a few hours there killing time before heading to the airport to return our car and get checked-in for the flight.

&amp;#x200B;

My main concerns right now are the arrival/departure plans I have, not sure if they are the best option and really need some input or opinions from others on this. For the car rental if I don't think I can make the pick-up time that night I will just get a taxi/uber/shuttle? to the airport the next day and pick-up then. We can still leave early enough to make stops along the coast on our way to Uvita. I am also unsure if my check-out/departure plans are solid. I don't want to stop at any point along the way from Uvita to San Jose since traffic may cause issues, but this leaves us with hours to kill before we should arrive at the airport. I am also concerned about recent COVID-19 spreading and did not see any negative test required for entering or leaving Costa Rica. I would love some clarity on that as well so I can plan accordingly.",Shoestring,1630026004

How does it work? We have a bot that searches a \*ton\* of flight and hotel prices for weekend trips in North America. We combine those flights and hotels together into trips, then send you the cheapest ones (with links to Google Flights/Hotels for easy booking). The trips are usually Friday-Sunday, but we just started including trips for long weekends too.

It scans \~350 destinations every week and send you deals as it finds them. You should get 1-2 deals a week (we added a Premium option if you really want more). It's surprising how little money you can spend if you're flexible on location!

1. Malaysia
2. Thailand
3. Japan (Too expensive for me now though)

1. Indonesia

I am planning on visiting the US and currently considering all the options I have. I've considered San Francisco, Chicago/Milwaukee and NYC so far.

I have a small budget (max $860) for 8 days in March 2022 (I'm from the UK, hopefully the ban will be lifted by then). (Flights don't count in the budget.)

Do you think it's possible to pack everything within that budget? So far, I've got this;

- AirBnB accomodation: $320
- NYC Pass and attractions: $240
- Food: $300 (only for lunches and dinners, breakfast is already provided)

Do you think such a budget is reasonable? I am a cheap traveler, I don't mind staying in low cost hotels and eating cheap food. My accommodation has a kitchen.

Looking for some suggestions for my upcoming trip I have booked going from NYC to Paris France. I am fully vaccinated 25M looking to make the best of my first trip to Europe. I have applied for the covid pass via the application on the government website, as of today, no response yet. Not sure if anything else will be required of me but I can easily get a covid test before leaving NYC. If anyone has more insights here please let me know! 

A little background. Initially I booked this trip with my SO for their friends wedding at a chateau in Burgundy that we would be staying at for a portion of the week. We recently split up and I am not going to get rid of my flight for some random travel credit I know I am going to forget about. I have never been to Europe before and am extremely excited to explore the city by myself and hopefully meet some cool people along the way. I fly into Paris and am currently just planning to just stay there for the entirety of the trip to for ease of travel but I am willing to go out of the city for a great experience/ cheaper accommodations. Currently I do not have a sleeping situation booked but know I need to lock it down ASAP. I have looked at a few hotels and Air b&amp;bs but feel lost on what arrondissement to stay in.  I have also considered a hostile to save some money but I would really prefer it to be clean and not very weird. If anyone has any suggestions on this it would be greatly appreciated. Couch surfing is also an option I am considering but would prefer to do a virtual meeting with anyone before considering that. Happy to hop on a zoom/facetime call anytime to chat! 

I have also considered planning the trip to be a wwoofing one to travel outside of the city and spend some time with the land and learning from whomever I stay with. I am a chef at heart and am looking to deeply learn and explore the food scene in France. Though it could be a little late in the game for that. 

If anyone also knows of a cool tour guide or someone who wants to show a New Yorker paris with some cool spots off the beat and path it would be incredible.  I like to think i’m a good conversationalist who’s easy to talk to about a wide range of topics food, sustainability, culture, architecture, art, fantasy books, video games, my hate for trump and just life itself. I enjoy drinking good wine and a good quality smoke.

TroupeTravel,plloav,New tool to help plan group trips!,"Hi everyone! I work for a small travel startup called [Troupe](http://www.troupe.com/) and for the last 18 months our team has been building an app to simplify group travel planning.

If you've ever planned a group trip, chances are you're familiar with the frustration of getting everyone on the same page. The endless email and text chains, the indecision over when to go or where to stay —  the list goes on and on. 

Troupe wants to simplify the process by getting everyone on the same page. Literally. It’s a place for friends to suggest and vote on when to go, where to stay, and what to do. That way you spend less time getting everyone to agree on the details and more time actually looking forward to your vacation.

We recently [launched in beta](http://www.troupe.com/) and would love to get your feedback on what we’ve built. It's completely free to use, so if you have a group trip coming up (or know someone who does), give Troupe a try and let us know what you think. 

You can find us at [www.troupe.com](http://www.troupe.com/) and send any feedback, big or small, to [hello@troupe.com](mailto:hello@troupe.com).",Shoestring,1631282593

Grijns_Official,orxpsp,Tips for traveling stockholm on a budget,"Stockholm is a crazy expensive place to travel to for us backpackers. Here’s some things I picked up on to make it a little more affordable. 

-TRANSPORT
transport is actually not THAT. Expensive compared to everything else, the 2 main tips I have are get the SL app. Where you can get your tickets for 75 minutes.

But while you are in the city I would really recommend the scooters placed throughout the city especially lime. You can get a day pass for 60kr (6 euro) which means you can go anywhere in the center where your heart desires! It might not be for everyone but especially us younger folk will enjoy these fun scooter rides in a city that is completely adapted to this form of transportation.

-STAY

Hostels are actually not as expansive as you might think compared to the food and other stuff you will pay for on your trip a hostel night. I got it down to 100kr per night

But here’s the kicker. There’s a hostel called STF af Chapman. Look it up! It’s a crazy stay for the money. I payed about 150kr per night and it really is worth it. You will be sleeping in the city center on an old decommissioned military ship! Just the experience alone is worth the money!

 

-FOOD
Food is where Stockholm gets really scary. If you eat at restaurants expect to pay 600kr on food every day! Kebab places are cheap(er) and getting a loaf of bread is probably not a bad idea from the coop supermarket.

Here’s a dumb tip for food: go to Ikea!! Their kitchen is amazingly priced and also a fun experience to visit Ikea while in Sweden. The oldest and biggest one is situated outside stockholm a little to the south and you can go there with a FREE busride. 

So technically the cheapest way to survive foodwise is take the free 20 min bus to ikea every day and eat there delicious meatballs for about 50kr!

Sweden will never be a cheap place to visit but there are ways to make it a little easier on your wallet. 

Take care! ~me from Stockholm🇸🇪",Shoestring,1627302638

alextheveyt,ovebzb,Itinerary Sharing Platform,"Hi, Alex here. I recently launched a crowdsourced travel itineraries platform with three colleagues/friends of mine. It's called Itinsy.

We've been live for a few months but already have over 600 itineraries that folks have posted. The idea came to me about two years ago on a trip to Italy with my wife where I had not done any research ahead of the trip (she had done all of it and was upset with me), but redeemed myself a bit when I got a few itineraries from colleagues who had taken similar trips before.

So I thought it would be extremely useful for the world to have a free platform where all itineraries could be shared. That's how it was born. On the platform, you're able to search and filter for itineraries based on destination, month, length of stay, cost and trip type for the perfect trip. By trip type, I mean using tags like #nationalparks or #hiking.

Some other features include:

* ability to build a travel profile of all locations you've been to and a visual map with pins that you could share with friends/family.
* save, react to, and give kudos to other itineraries
* social feed to connect with like-minded travelers, ask questions, form groups and get advice - message and follow users too.
* fun community experience with points, coins, badges, rewards, reputation scores

To encourage folks to post their itineraries, for now, we are giving away Amazon gift cards for each itinerary that's shared.

Firstly, I wanted to share here because hopefully it's of interest to folks planning their trips.

Itinsy.com

Secondly, very open to feedback and ways we can improve / other features you would like to see. Feel free to email me directly ([alex@itinsy.com](mailto:alex@itinsy.com)) or share your feedback below.

As I did plan on going to OGG, but on a later date, I was able to call and make the flight change for less than $20 in ticket price changes. This was a stark difference in costs when compared to booking a flight straight to HNL, and a separate flight from HNL to OGG. I saved over $200 per ticket this way, mostly by chance.

They were expensive holidays that were made miserable by the weather.

So to avoid this, I set a week aside in April (2018) and waited till a couple of days before and looked up where was sunny in Europe and booked it (happened to be Majorca!). Worked out great! Sunny every day! And it was a steal in terms of cost.

The Nat Geo article is from 2019, and some of the links it uses are defunct.

 I've also never backpacked within a national park, only motel'd and drived in or car-camping, or backpacking in the Adirondacks- so uh, I don't know the likelihood of getting a permit when walking in.

I've always been interested in travelling to Turkey given how beautiful it is and the good experiences my friends have had.

I would regard myself as a travelling noob, having only travelled with family or friends who plan everything out. As such, I would like to ask you all for advice on what sort of experience I can expect on such a budget, if I should increase it, if its better to sign up for a travel package rather than plan it out myself, or if its a bad time to travel to there in that timeframe.

I'm looking to spend most of my time in Istanbul and the surrounding areas as I really enjoy architecture and history. As for Cappadocia, the hot air balloons are definitely on my list, and a day tour/hike would be nice. Any further suggestions as to what I should/can do would be greatly appreciated!

* I can take a bus from Pärnu to Latvia or Lithuania if that makes the fare cheaper.
* I can take a ship from Tallinn to Helsinki if that makes the fare cheaper.

* My luggage is medium size and weight, 7-9kg and 70cm height x 50cm width x 30cm depth

We already booked a cheap hotel + our flight. I have about $800 saved for food, travel around city, excursions and shopping and plan on saving at least an extra $200 to have $1000 for just spending on the trip (everything excluding the hotel and flight cost which is already paid). My boyfriend might have a little less saved. The trip is one week and is later this summer. 

Here’s what I figured: $40 a day for food, but it’d be nice to find places that’s be cheaper to eat at + one expensive but not too expensive (like $50-70 range for one dinner) Italian restaurant for a night. So looking for other cheap restaurants for rest of trip. 

Cheap and free and even underrated excursions. And also on the lookout for a cheap show that doesn’t necessarily have to be Broadway. Willing to support smaller theater.

Minuku,o8oro8,Tips for a trip through (Eastern) Europe,"Hello! I would really like to make a trip through countries I haven't visited in Europe (I'm from Germany) but I have a rather small budget with which I want to see as many countries as possible. I planned in like 10-20 days for the trip in August. 

First of all I thought of Interrail ticket and AirBnB but the more I made my research I came to the conclusion that an Interrail ticket was totally not worth it. I would enjoy an Eastern European trip. My first thought was to take a cheap flight to Estonia and use the very cheap trains there to get around the Baltic and then into Poland, all countries I have never visited. Maybe even continuing into Finland, Slovakia, Hungary and so on but the question is how much time I want to spent in each city and how many cities I want to see in each country. I think I fairly cut down on travelling costs by using flixbus and cheap train connections and also using Airbnb (and not being too picky about the apartments). But I would really like to hear tips from you how to cut costs and still have amazing travel, especially in Baltic and Central/Eastern Europe. And if you made a similar journey through the area, what were things you enjoyed and things I should better be careful about? Even though I made some smaller travels before I didn't really make this kind of travel experience before and don't really know how to pull this off correctly.   


I also give you a map from the countries I have visited in my life and countries I haven't but am able to visit (I don't want to get through a visa process just for this travel if it isn't worth it). [https://imgur.com/a/oV1342i](https://imgur.com/a/oV1342i)

I've been reading about there being great public transit options there for cheap so renting a car wouldn't be necessary, and the AirBnb options look like a great fit for low cost lodging that will let us bounce around instead of have to stay in one place for the whole trip to save money. 

Here are my top questions, but any and all suggestions and tips are welcome!

\-I'm having trouble finding maps of the train/bus/lightrail systems to see how close they get us to some of our destinations. It seems like main connections like Bucharest to Turda should be doable, but not sure about getting to places like Nerei - Beușnița Ravine National Park without adding a taxi or something. I'd also like to get an idea of the timeframe, as if a 6hr drive takes 10+ by train renting a car may be worth it for the flexibility and time saved.

\-In a perfect world, we could sneak over to Kyiv, Ukraine area for a day or so and visit near Chernobyl too. From what I'm seeing flying from Bucharest to Kyiv would be our best bet, but we're open to other suggestions!

\-Anything we wouldn't think to see/do that you have come across and would suggest we add to our itinerary? We're big into ""off the beaten path"" experiences rather than touristy ones (he's a photographer, so bonus points for cool/unique scenery). 

\-Any great suggestions to save money on airfare are welcome as well. We're currently looking at about $1600/RT for the two of us from Colorado to Bucharest. I've played with booking one-way tickets, or flying from different starting points,etc. (Using all the usual Kayak, Google, Kiwi, etc to check as well as playing on the individual airline sites like Turkish airlines)

citruslibrary,ocprah,"Help: should i take the risk to book this cheap ticket now, or wait until my passport has gotten here??","Hi everyone, question is as above. Would appreciate any advice anyone has.

Essentially I have been waiting for my passport since 05/24 of this year, and three of my representatives are helping with expediting it. On 06/28, I got an email from one of my representatives that the passport processing center said they would have my passport app located and reviewed, and printed/shipped as soon as possible. I have made clear that I have my travel date scheduled for 07/19.

So i guess my question is, should I take the gamble and book my ticket now and assume it must arrive before my travel date (07/19) to London from NYC, or should I wait until my passport is here to book it officially?  If so, what are so good places/tricks for booking last-minute flights?? 

**My biggest worry is price and quality of flight:** I am afraid that once my passport is here, there will be no more cheap deals for NYC to London, and I just found the cheapest deal I've seen so far for around $720, straight flight back and forth, including taxes and 1 checked/1 carried baggage (all other prices i've been able to find on skyscanner and aerlingus have been 770 or above). 

I'm very tempted to book the flight now, but I am also worried about taking the risk of booking a flight that does not offer free cancellation/flexibility god forbid my passport arrives late.

I’ve spent time in the Ecuadorian Amazon and Cloud Forests for a good amount of time, skateboarded in Shanghai in August, and hiked around Joshua Tree in July-August. Speaking with my cousin, I’m not sure if I can handle the heat in the Yucatán nor would I be able to bop around as freely as I did with Ecuadorian busses and hostels. I love nature, la selva, and insect photography and Cabo has none of that. 

I’m likely canceling my Merida flight (only $90) and will try to rent a car and snorkel instead to get my nature fix. My current hobby is photography for iNaturalist. I’ll also probably have to fly to Cancun which I assume is cheap so I can then fly out to JFK to be smart with counting my losses.

Could anyone recommend what areas to stay or which services to use? How is food cost, would dining out be cheap?

Something at a good price point (looking to spend no more than absolute max 180 a night for accommodations --- we would split this, not much more than 200 airfare --- if everything else is cheap enough, may be open to more. For instance, my friend found a flight to Portugal for $350 and flights within Europe are cheap, I just don't know much about other costs and it's already 12hrs to get there), easy to get around in that either a car isn't needed or isn't complicated, not too much travelling required within the country and not too far, food isn't pricey (hopefully delicious), and it's safe enough for 4 women.

I am a female traveling solo, but it’s not my first time. I’ve been to Japan, England and France solo but obviously Central America is a different animal. I have and currently do live in big inner cities so I’m used to keeping a head on a swivel and not making myself out to be a target. Would it be that bad if I went by myself?

I am trying to save money but don’t necessarily want to sacrifice on quality accommodations and must see tours and activities. I do use hostels a lot and enjoy it as long as it has some amenities. 

Any tips, tricks, or advice would be super appreciated! Also if anyone has specific trips or tours to do please feel free to link them! I love to see historical sites of any place that I go to but I also love a lazy day by the beach.",Shoestring,1622727337

internetexplorer2707,mwg1x4,Is buying a plane ticket to Greece this summer advisable?,"
Would booking a plane ticket to Greece in mid June be advisable or would you avoid due to covid?


I apologize for the low quality post I’m quite new to posting. I’ve been thinking about solo traveling for a long time now but due to covid plans had to be shelved for a later time. Finally, with many people getting the vaccine some countries are slowly opening up to tourists in the upcoming months. I’ve read recently that Greece would be opening up soon to tourists in May so I was wondering if booking a trip in mid June for a month or so would be recommended. If I go, I plan on visiting some islands in the Cyclades and also visiting Crete for a week or two as a sort of chill “cool down” from all the exhausting island hopping. 

I’m 21M from the US and I plan on staying in hostels if I can although I wouldn’t mind staying in a relatively cheap room due to the fact that there are not many hostels in the Cyclades. (Will likely find a decent room to stay in Crete)

My biggest worry would be buying the ticket in advance and then Greece having to close to visitors before my trip. I’m running on a budget so not being able to get a refund would kinda suck.

Hello everyone, I recently discovered this subreddit this is my first time posting.
This Itinerary was Created During  the beginning of the pandemic last year. The plan was to go with my cousin in 2022 but after this whole thing we may have to put it off. 
However, I’m posting it to see if these numbers are reasonable, I put a lot of time looking up prices and honestly I’m somewhat confident with it because I have been to some of these countries and speak the language and have haggled myself, but I’ve never done it full backpacker style so I might be underestimating the prices going too low. 

FINAL TOTAL INCLUDE A 30$ DAILY BUDGET, TICKETS FOR TRANSPORTATION WITHIN THE COUNTRY, AND ABOUT 100$ BUFFER MONEY.

FLIGHTS NOT INCLUDED WITH BUDGET

FabriFibra87,mwx5op,Any destinations near U.S. that are like Mexico City?,"Went on one of the absolute best trips of my life a couple years back - flew out to Mexico City from NYC.

Stayed there for 4-5 days and honestly wished I'd had at least a week.  Has *so* much going for it:

\- Relatively close to the U.S., about a 5-6 hour flight

\- Cheap as hell, due to the peso VS dollar exchange rate and to how many cheap dining &amp; lodging options there are

\- Incredible street food and restaurants all around

\- Amazing history and culture; no end to the museums, opera houses, ruins and tours in the center and beyond

\- Unique experiences - drifting down the river from Xochimilco, watching Mexican Luchadores at the arena, eating eyeball/brain tacos that were *actually really good*, and more

\- Close proximity to other sites to visit (Cathedral of Guadalupe, Teotihuacan Pyramids, and more)

\- Kind, open, friendly locals 

And while we couldn't drink the local water and had to keep our wits about us, I never felt unsafe.

So, question to the equally frugal people on this sub:  **any key options for travel near the United States (or even** ***in*** **the United States, I guess) that compare to Mexico City**?  Trying to plan out the next place to visit and fly / drive out to from NYC, once things get back under control.  And yeah, thinking more on this side of the planet versus crossing an ocean.

If all else fails, I may just go to Cancun or any other popular city in Mexico - though I would like to change it up a bit.  I hear Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro are both amazing in their own way, but are both much further to reach and more expensive.

bbjimin,mx8ed8,I have a bunch of first time solo traveler questions :),"**QUICK PREFACE:** No, I'm not *exactly* on a ""shoestring"" budget but I would like to keep things very cheap except in situations where you're paying a little bit extra for a big return in comfort or convenience. Example being if a hostel is $27 and an airbnb is $31, I'd probably just pay the extra $4 for the airbnb. If the hostel is $27 and the airbnb is $50 I'm definitely choosing the hostel.   

I have very high hopes of solo travelling next year starting early 2022. I haven't fully decided exactly what my route is going to be or how long I'm going (very dependent on whether or not I decide to take advantage of the working holiday visa or if that even works out) but I'm hoping for at least  6 months in Europe/Asia. My budget will hopefully be around $10k CAD/8k USD. I don't intend on going on extreme budget but I'd definitely like the trip to be quite long and won't be spending frivolously or spending my entire trip in airbnbs.

Also I know a lot of this can be answered with google but I find personal responses to be a lot more helpful.

**LUGGAGE**

**1a**. What bag(s) do you recommend? I've seen solo travelers with these massive backpacks on and I imagine I'll have to do the same as I probably won't be spending a super long time in any given city (though there are definitely cities I plan on booking a 2-4 week airbnb in to emulate ""living"" there if the price is right and my initial impression is good.)

**1b.** How do you take a huge bag on an airplane? Maybe I'm slightly overestimating the size, but wouldn't a bag you're literally living out of typically be too big for a carry on and therefore be a checked bag? I've only been on a few flights and I've already had a checked bag lost once, I feel like that would be a very stressful experience especially when I'd likely be on so many different flights. I feel like having a normal backpack would make sense to have your important stuff in but then you're carrying around two bags.

**HOSTELS**

**2a.** How do hostels actually work?  This is somewhat tied in with the first question because I have no idea if you can book a bed/room at a hostel for several days and whether or not there's adequate storage (or any locked storage at all) so that you can leave your big backpack or most of your stuff back at the hostel. Basically I have a LOT of backpack questions lol.

**2b.** What are hostels even like? For some reason I imagine them as not-the-nicest living quarters with several beds per room but maybe that's just driven by their super low cost and being popular for those on a very tight budget (my budget is nothing insane but I'm not going to go as cheap as humanly possible on my first big trip)

**2c.** How much do hostels typically cost? From what I've seen it obviously varies heavily based on city (and I've heard some hostels are even more expensive than airbnb/hotel) but what do they typically cost in a big city vs I guess a medium popularity city? I just looked prices up in a few cities and they actually seem very expensive in bigger cities (like $30-50USD+ which seems insane for a shared room)

**2d.** Do hostels typically have laundry rooms or do you need to use a local laundromat usually?

**COSTS**

**3a.** How much would you say you spend per month on average? Obviously staying in Paris for a month will be much more expensive than somewhere in say Romania but I'm mostly looking for averages as I'd like to see a lot of Europe/Asia. I'm hoping to save around 10k CAD/8k USD for the entire trip so while I'm not going extreme budget I would like to make it last quite long rather than spending 2.5k a month.

**3c.** I've seen a lot of people say to ship souvenirs home rather than lug them around but what's the most cost effective way of doing this? Shipping is super expensive so I can't imagine sending things from EU to Canada to be very cheap especially if it's a semi regular thing. I don't plan on buying an extreme amount of stuff but probably a couple things here and there. I'd rather spend my money living in Europe rather than sending things home to make me sad when I return to Canada lol.

New York is very popular , busy , the city that never sleeps but it’s sooooo worth the trip , so many iconic scenes - You literally walk around saying - seen this and seen that - It’s in so and so film !! 

We first arrived on the 5th August 2019 in 30 odd degree hit wandering the streets trying to find the bus terminal for ages ! ( we were like pretty much right next to it on multiple occasions) heat obviously got to us , plus the rare sight well maybe not in *New York* but from where I’m from of 2 guys just shooting up on the street ..! 
First quote of the trip , a guy seeing us looking shocked said - get used to it !!! 
Buses are really easy to use and gets you to the Jersey side for like $2 a time !! Watch out for morning commuters and heading back out of the City around 5pm- 7pm ! The queues are something else !! 

We travelled all the way down to *Miami* on *Amtrak* which is a great way to travel *America* - quick, easy and comfortable ( when the air con works!!) 
We also stayed in Air b n b ‘s - don’t rate these enough - we had some amazing stays including New York - Our Host Marlon, we will be forever grateful for , as a gift took us to see the skyline at night from the *New Jersey* side

Hop On - Hop Off Bus ! I think is the best way to travel round New York - so many routes and so easy to navigate ( you get a map or the app)  you grab a set of headphones 🎧 and you are set to learn everything you need to know about The Big Apple 🍏  but be aware they will try rip you off ... don’t just accept the first price - they will always go down! 

I’ve just given you my top places to see but also they is 
- Brooklyn Bridge 
- Wall Street 
- Sakura Park 
- Rockefeller’s 
- Shopping 🛍!!!

admi99,myaelu,Travelling in Europe from 1500$,"Hey guys!

I'm from Hungary and I would like to travel in Europe with my girlfriend and our budget is about 1500$.  
We are planning an active vacation, visit as much  attraction as we can. We love natural beauties, cityscapes and cultural sights too.  We want to be kinda close to the sea, so we can relax a bit at the beach. 

We will also carry 2 suitcase and 2 backpack with us. We want to stay for about 10-14 days as the budget allows.

We don't need a Hotel, but in the same time we also don't want to stay in a hostel, so an avarage apartment would be enough for us.  
We won't be able to rent a car so we only could use public transportation.

These are the places we thinking about:

* Greece
   * Corfu with Sarande
   * Crete 
   * Santorini &amp; Athens
* Montenegro
* Malta
* Portugal
   * Azores islands
   * Algavre with Lisbon

These are just some ideas so we glad to listen for any other option.

So I'd be glad if you could recommend some country(s) with attractions, transport, accomodations and more.  If you have a better idea how should we plan and where should we go and how I'd be really happy.

Thanks in advance guys!",Shoestring,1619364045
weepingwillows123,mykhze,Road trip! Chicago to Yellowstone,"Hello! My sister and I (24F and 21F) are hoping to travel to Yellowstone from Chicago in June. We have a very tight budget, and will be taking my little sedan. We are hoping to do this round trip in 7 - 8 days (but longer if we come out under $800 per person!). 

I already figured out our first full day and a half. Lots of miles with a lunch stop in Sioux Falls, the Badlands for sunset, and Hill City, SD for the night. Day 2 will be sunrise at Mt. Rushmore, a quick run to Crazy Horse and straight to west Yellowstone, MT. 

On the way to Yellowstone I wrote down haunted hotels in Buffalo and Cody, WY. There’s also a ghost town called Kirwin somewhere near Cody. On the way back home, I think we might travel to South Pass City (ghost town), and through Cheyenne. 

After 2-3 full days at Yellowstone, I think we could spend a day or two in Idaho or MT nearby. 

I’m looking for recommendations of the following:

1) Haunted towns/places

2) Where should we travel to once we’re done with Yellowstone? 

3) We have second cousins in central Minnesota, so we would be willing to come back to Chicago via MT and North Dakota rather than to Cheyenne through Nebraska/Iowa. 

4) Cheap ($100-$150) and CLEAN accommodations? No motels or Super 8s.

5) And good foodie places? We will have a cooler with us to eat grocery store food most of the time, but will make exceptions for anything REALLY good. 

6) Anything else we can do that is fun!! 

Thank you!!",Shoestring,1619393541

I’ve been attracted to Eastern Europe as a travel destination for awhile now, and am looking to make something work over the span of two weeks this September.

My budget is somewhat flexible because I intend to take out travel loans for this, but I’d also like to keep it affordable. Let’s say, the whole trip under $5,000. I might be going with someone, so we would prefer to stay in Airbnb’s, and maybe occasionally some hostels.

Croatia
Slovenia
Romania
Bulgaria.
Open to visiting adjacent major cities if it’s logically consistent with the rest of my itinerary (Belgrade in Serbia, Prague in Czechia, etc). 

I’m extremely interested in visiting Brasov in particular.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice for sights to see, cities to go to, if this is a realistic budget, etc. Is it possible to rent and drive a vehicle with a US drivers license? If so, how?

Backstory:

I love my dog and I adopted her in December--she got all her vaccines when I adopted her and a full check-up... then I took her to a local vet who confirmed she is perfectly healthy, but needed a teeth cleaning with anesthesia.  She has her teeth cleaning last month--and again the vet noted she is imperfect health.

Now, for a family event, I am traveling with my dog across the country.  I already paid for her doggy ticket for in-cabin flight....  All these vet visits are EXPENSIVE and I'd rather save my money to buy a gift for the family I am visiting.

Any tips?  - Honestly, I'd love to save $110",Shoestring,1619540127

Hi there

So this is something that i feel my soul really needs to do, im 28F , have no kids, recently came out of a relationship and have no one depending on me. Been wanting to do this since i was 17.

I do have debt which i am working on paying off my working my ass off in overtime this year, and then have some savings as well.

i have a job that is quite lucrative and allows for me to come back and work again in the field ( it might be difficult but i plan on ending things on good terms at my current post and with my good work ethic i can see myself in the field again) - it might be difficult at first but i have a close cousin that offered for me to crash at her place if i dont have a place to stay so i have that going for me.

My worry is, will i have enough saved to be able to just survive off my savings? I know this sounds cheesy but i want to sit with the monks in Nepal, chant with the shamans in Asia. i want to experience all cosines and various cultures. i want to meet people and really say i LIVED and did it.

But how good is backpacking? am i able to live in hostels when i have lived my entire life in my own apartment with my own luxuries?  
i have read that some people do remote online teaching and still get to work or become digital nomads.  
The idea of earning something while travelling sounds settling but then again i dont want to feel 'stuck' at something i dont like which is my current issue.

So many different thoughts running through my mind which creates so much fear and then makes me doubt myself

In light of the Coronavirus, I’m wondering if there is a similar walk here in the United States?  The Camino started centuries ago as pilgrims from all over Europe would come to the shrine dedicated to St. James at Santiago de Compostela.  I am not looking to do a religious pilgrimage, but like the idea of walking from town to town, through countryside, mountains, cities if necessary.  I will walk. I will carry minimal supplies.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  Thanks!

Additional info after reading these first responses to my post....


Thanks so much for the helpful feedback.

I turned 59 this year and just a few years ago did quite a bit of weekend backpacking mostly in North Carolina.  While i used to entertain thoughts of hiking the AT, PCT, John Muir, etc., tackling one of these wilderness trails (in its entirety) is no longer on my to-do list. I admire those who do (and know a few who did) but that much of a wilderness challenge is not for me.

The Camino may be something I can do once this highly infectious disease is subdued. Considering the close quarters pilgrims and others who walk the Camino shelter in, it may be a while before that happens.

Why the Camino?  While the Camino is specifically a pilgrimage for many, indeed if not for most, there are some who walk for other reasons.  For me I see the Camino as a physical and mental challenge, (hopefully) a doable one.  I love to walk and from what I’ve seen, why not walk - calmly, peacefully - through some of the most beautiful countrysides. While I don’t see this as a pilgrimage personally, I do think I’ll experience some kind of transformation by walking along this “trail” so many others from so many other times and countries have done before me. But if I don’t, that’s ok.  I expect that the comradery, drinking local wines, eating local foods and meeting locals and those from other countries will be well worth the effort.

So when I think about walking in the US, I know nothing exactly like the Camino exists here in the US, but wonder if there are walks here that incorporate some of what is available on the Camino.  Maybe there’s something regional like the Chimayo in NM - thanks for that suggestion.  I just found out about a trail called the American Discovery Trail.  My research continues.

That being said, I know people who just spend months at a time traveling in their life, and I am just envious and confused.  How can they do that?  I know I could stretch out a dollar by staying in hostels or tents, biking over driving, etc., but do these people just save up enough and then quit their jobs for 6 months and then start over?  Do some cash out their 401k and use that to fund a trip?

We are hoping someone can recommend a location to us using the following criteria:

Price: Hoping to keep this relatively inexpensive – ideally &lt;1200pp including lodging and flights

Vibe: Laid back, relatively quiet, no need for much in the way of amenities. The lodging can be pretty bare bones, as long as the area is safe.  We don’t need any shopping or nightlife. Good food is important, but we don’t need upscale restaurants …any place that can grill some seafood or local food works.

Safety: We are lesbians and need a relatively LGBT friendly location. We would not travel to a place where there are laws against homosexuality. That being said we aren’t showy and are fine with no PDA.

Activities: We are looking for a nature-based vacation with access to biodiversity – underwater, on land or both. In general we like:

\- Snorkeling\* (e.g. biodiversity, reef quality etc…). Note that I cannot scuba dive due to a medical condition, but we are both good swimmers and would hire a boat to go into open water if necessary.

\- Hanging out on the beach. We don’t need white sand and don’t mind rocks. Scenic beauty is more important than a resort style atmosphere

\- Rainforests. I realize this may not be possible in combination with the other factors, but we’d be willing to give up beach/snorkeling in order to spend time on guided hikes in a rainforest area. Ideally, we would still be able to get some swimming in though, perhaps if there are natural pools in the area.

If you have any thoughts about places that might fight some/most of these criteria, let me know!

Optimal_Difficulty_4,n53mqh,10-14 days in London/Paris with (USD) $3000 budget,"Hi!
As the title implies I will be spending about two weeks in London and Paris. My 5-day itinerary in London is open-ended so I would like suggestions, and my time in Paris will be a bit more structured (still open to plenty of suggestions). 

This trip will be revolved around the Monaco GP, an event I’ve longed to attend since my inception. I plan on spending about $1100 total on traveling expenses (Flights, Chunnel, etc.). As an American, I do not know the traveling logistics from Paris to Monaco and I also hear getting in and out of Monaco is difficult. Would someone be so kind to explain how I can get to Monaco efficiently from Paris? What can I expect a night for staying in Monaco during the GP? Granted it will be ridiculous, I won’t spend more than one night there. I plan to conclude my trip with the GP and travel back from Monaco to Paris, Paris to London and fly out of Heathrow to SFO. 

I’m basically writing this to see if my $3000 budget is realistic. Here it is so far:

$1100: Travel expenses
$200: Monaco GP ticket
$350: Memorabilia expenses
$500: food expenses
$880: Hotels/Hostels (mostly Monaco)

rakahr11,mkm1d8,What shoestring travel story made you proud of yourself? What have you learned by conveniently travelling at a low cost?,"If i think about my travels i must say, that i was a little judgy in the very beginning of them. I compared backpacking with all-in resort packages, actual backpack carrying with trolley rollers and hotel bookings with family run cozy guesthouses.

I learned that everyone travels differently and that i shouldn't judge the way people travel. There is no 'one real way' but simply preferences.

Sometimes it depends on the available budget, the age or even just the place you visit.

What i am proud though is the personal change i went through during my very first year and a half exploring south and east asia. I went with basically no luggage (3kg), just a handbag with some underwear, a second  shirt and the clothes i had on.

I promised myself only to buy what i would need and ended up having only 7kg of luggage at all times. It was very comfortable to live the minimalistic life, though it only works in rather hot climates, i suppose.

I also learned that sometimes, the slightly more expensive option has a better value than the cheapest. It is nice to avoid a bed bug situation or having an actual lock on the door.

I felt that the 'little things' slowly eat up silently a budget. The night out in a beach shack, hygiene products from western brands, the not-thought-through impulsive  itinerary or a fixed mindset about certain places that are a 'must' to visit.

I also needed to learn, that while eating out is great, especially in certain countries, a place with the possibility to cook might just be the more convenient option.

With this said, one thing that has kind of been implemented in my had is the question: ""do i really need/want that?""

It can be a bit tiring to also question. I feel that the 2 weeks splurge vacation with the 'i don't care attitude' might be a nice thing to do once in a while. 

Especially with long term travel, having a vacation from your travels sometimes just gives you back that energy. Just the feeling of being save in a place you know your way around is very relieving.

How about you?

NomadCouncil,mmp6vt,Europe in a budget. Hostel life?," 

I am trying to find an easy solution to book my “post lockdown six months around Europe workation”

Unfortunately finding housing in some places in Europe has become very difficult, especially when you are searching from abroad, so many scammers bruh!

I would like to spend one month in Amsterdam, Berlin, Copenhagen, Budapest, Marseille...

I don’t wanna worry about, deposits furniture, and I don’t feel like getting into any yearly membership. I just feel like winging it...but here is the catch: 2020 left my bank account dry.

Once i stayed in an airbnb for a month in Amsterdam and  paid like 1600 for a month, and i thought it was cheap...but those were the good old times when I had a stable job…:(

So far the only website I found that offers something I can afford is [urbanroomie.com](https://urbanroomie.com)

They have some rooms starting at 300-400 euros per month in hostels, this could be cool for socializing… but they don’t seem to have anything in France...

FlippinFlags,mmu5dl,Mexico City - the shoestring destination you didn't know about.,"I'm headed back to Mexico City for the third time.. so figured why not repost this from a year or two back.

From ""Why would I want to go to Mexico City?  To .. Mexico City is my favorite city in the entire world""

=

Since most of the users here are probably from the USA I want to give a suggestion that few Americans seem to know about or consider..

I know I didn’t..

Mexico City (CDMX)

I first kept hearing about it here on Reddit and shrugged it off as “It’s Mexico”.. but it kept popping up in all different subs on how much people loved it..

So I went down the rabbit hole of research on here as well as a lot of Googling: Top 10 Mexico City/CDMX as well as YouTube..

It looked amazing, was incredibly cheap.. so decided to go.

My first trip was about two weeks and it was amazing, everything I thought it would be and more..

Usually a few days or so in a big city and you’ve kind of seen everything and I start to get a little bored.. but there was a lot more to do here than most cities..

Then another part of the Shoestring part:

About 6 months later I wanted to go somewhere for NYE.. I looked everywhere in the Caribbean and Central America and South America.. since it was the holidays, flights and accommodation were outrageous everywhere..

I spent around $600 from what I remember correctly for 2.5 weeks.. this was for everything: Flights, accommodation, transportation, food, entertainment etc.

Just the flight alone to somewhere like Cancun, Jamaica or Puerto Vallarta was more than my entire trip.

So we booked CDMX again.. this time it would be about a 2.5 week trip.

Cheap flights from the USA - we flew from Texas at $210 round trip

Amazing food:

Super cheap amazing street food OR Very nice sit down meal and fine dining restaurants for $15+

Cheap accommodation - we did a private room in an AirBnB for $15 a night.  

2021 EDIT/UPDATE I just booked a private room for $150 for the month.  Private apartments start at around $250/300 if you look for a deal.

Uber is like $2 for car pool for most of our rides.

But, we basically walked or bicycled everywhere..

CDMX is one of the most bicycle friendly cities I’ve been in.. lots of bike lanes and the traffic is very aware and courteous.. and they have hundreds of kiosks where you enter in your code and off you go.. and then drop it off at another kiosk..  

Highly recommended and one the main highlights to me.

I think there's around 500 of these bicycle kiosks with 10-20+ bikes in a very small area.. one on almost every block.

Go to a kiosk, grab a bike and ride to wherever you wanna go... do whatever you wanna do, then grab a bike and go somewhere else, such a great fun way to explore the city.

They also close down the main streets on Sunday mornings just for walkers and bicycle riders.. no cars allowed..  and thousands of people take to the streets.. such fun.

I think it's $25 for the entire year / or I believe around $10 for a two weeks?  

ECOBICI is the name if you're interested in looking into it.  


WHAT TO DO:

The city has everything.

Now I haven’t been there in over a year so I know I’m forgetting some main things but here are most of my favorites:

Historic cool old buildings and churches (has a European feel to the city)

LA MERCED MARKET - It's the largest market in all of Latin America - (ONLY go during the morning/daytime)

Tons of absolutely amazing parks - Chapultepec Park is the main one but there are dozens more.  I think I read there's more green space/parks than anywhere else in all of The Americas but could be wrong.

Great city walk in with some really cool neighborhoods - Centro Historico, La Condesa, Polanco (rich area).

Great museums - don’t miss seeing the Aztec Sun Stone (Aztek Calendar) - it’s huge! (Museum of Anthropology)

LUCHA LIBRE - Mexican wrestling - Arena Mexico - I’ve always sat in the first or second row - they will literally fight in the stands right next to you - it’s like WWE on steroids - buy your tickets during the day from the actual box office.

FRIDA KHALO House - the neighborhood and local market is nice too

Xhochimilco - boat rides through the rivers (Island of the Dolls is another option here) great for groups or a couple - some will have 20+ - it’s quiet during the week or a big party place on the weekends.. music, food, entertainment as you’re pushed along on a big bright colorful boat.

Don’t forget to check out the Axolotls as I think this is the last place in the world where they exist.

Teotihuacan Pyramids - you can take the public bus from the north part of the city or hire a private car/bus. Can’t miss.

A FEW OTHER SMALLER MUST SEES:

Sears Department Store coffee shop (tea and pastries as well) 8th floor - hidden gem - outdoor seating area with an amazing view of Palacio de Bellas Artes.

El Morro - legendary local place - 3-4+ locations - hot chocolate and churros - often an hour wait just to get a table

THE FOOD!

Amazing food, amazing food, amazing food! This can’t be said enough.. tacos tacos tacos

If you like Mexican food - you won’t want to leave.

I’m pretty well traveled at around 30+ countries; and Mexico City is my favorite city in the world.

If you’re looking for a place to go on more of a budget check it out, it may just work for you.

Watch a few Top 10 videos on YouTube and get a feel for it.

r/mexicocity is also a great sub for more info and itinerary suggestions

We really want somewhere we can relax on the beach (so we're thinking Caribbean), but also enjoy activities like hiking, kayaking and snorkeling, etc. I went to Riviera Maya, Mexico as a child and I remember a bunch of fun excursions, but we are unsure about Mexico because of safety and covid (however we will all be fully vaccinated by may). My friend has also been to Grand Cayman and loved it so much and wants to go back (swimming with sting rays, etc), so we we're looking into that but have heard that it is very expensive and no all inclusive resorts. We are also open to any of the Virgin Islands. We would be flying out of NYC and out budget ranges from $1,000-$1,500 each (flights and hotel included- but if he hotel isn't all inclusive we would want to spend less). We were also looking into Costa Rica because that seems the most adventurous option, however, a lot of blogs have said 10 days is ideal for CR and everything is further apart. We also read that CR isn't the best place to relax on the beach and is more for hiking, exploring, etc. We would also need a really safe destination because we are 3 girls and kind of nervous to travel alone :) which is also why we are leaning towards hotel rather than airbnb because we would have shuttle busses that could take us to excursions, etc. Also, one more thing to note is the weather in the country at the end of May.

hope you are well!

Not sure if its okay to share here, but it might be pretty interesting for you guys- I tracked down all of my expenses from the start of the big trip in the end of 2014 on a daily basis, collecting all the data in an Excel sheet.

To be precicse (as the German I am), I was on the road with actual active traveling days for 2,87 years and **my total cost summed up to 24.227,69 € during 1047 days with an average per day cost of 23,14 €.** I updated this data with some extra trips during my last job and after the round the world trip, thats why the Infographic shows data till 2020 but most of it comes from the 2014-2017 period.

The cheapest country was Myanmar with 2.65€ average spend on food and the most expensive was Canada with 12.80€. I use the same kind of eating behavior in all countries, so its a nice metric to compare the countries too. No Restaurants usually, lots of fast food and self cooking, based on availabilty and location.

If you would like to read up more about the details of my stats, feel free to check out this post:  [**How much does it cost to travel the world?**](https://www.chrisontour84.de/budget-travel/travel-costs/)

Have you been traveling full time as well and what was your daily average to compare? I think I am on the low end due to the extensive use of Couchsurfing, Camping and Hitchhiking, keeping the general spent very low. Looking forward to hear stories from other fellow full time travlers :)

i’m a 22 year old solo female heading out in may for a great american adventure until next january — before i start at university and settle down into my boring old life again. i am an author and i work independently(: i have a budget of about 1500 a month for transport, housing, food, &amp; expenses. i planned to spend a couple weeks in each state on my tentative itinerary, with an emphasis on hiking &amp; sightseeing. i am required to return home every 10-12 weeks for a doctor’s appointment, but this isn’t a huge deal.

initially, i wanted to use the cheapest airbnbs available, usually aiming for less than 20 bucks a day. this totals to about 400 for a couple weeks or 800-850 for the month — including service &amp; cleaning fees. but they disappear quickly, some hosts are flakey, and the cheapest airbnbs seem... very inaccessible or strange. without a car, i still need to be able to get groceries &amp; leave the immediate vicinity of the home, but the cheapest private rooms tend to be on a road flung out in the middle of nowhere. as a solo female, i’m not comfortable couchsurfing. it’s not only important that i’m safe, but i also need consistent wifi to complete my work and some private space. i considered hostels, but the united states doesn’t really have hostels, unfortunately. the ones here are wildly overpriced for an unsafe bunkbed in a moldy old house — so that’s out of the question:(

recently, i’ve considered conversion vans. i live in florida and it would take a hot minute to get to the other coast and back, but i have the time. i could take my time at each rural destination and stealth park in cities. i want to hit as many national parks as possible and hike for hours, so an rv seems like a much more suitable choice for this. if properly outfitted, i could have internet access and an outlet — or i could drive to a starbucks and find wifi for free. i like the freedom granted from a van but my insurance rates will be high and gas costs need to be factored in. i’ve worked out the math and, moving slowly, i’m guessing it wouldn’t be much less than airbnbs... the only benefit is that transportation is dealt with, housing is stable, i feel safer, &amp; i own the van at the end of the day.

currently, i could only afford a van less than 5k in value and those tend to be older &amp; junkier. i absolutely do not want to breakdown on a highway, in the middle of nowhere, so i planned to bring any van i am considering buying to a mechanic. as a solo female, i find vans somewhat preferable to airbnbs, as i am in control of my own environment and i have a significant amount more privacy. there’s the labor &amp; upfront cost to factor in: i would have to outfit it to some extent and maybe hire an electrician to do the work that i can’t. it sounds like a fun project, but i have about two months to wrap everything up and i’d like
my basics handled (bed, place to keep food, etc) before i hit the road. 

both options have pros and cons, like convenience and stability vs comfort and ease. i’d like to hear your opinions on whether airbnb or rv life is more financially feasible within my budget (1000 on lodging and transport, the other 500 needs to go to other expenses) and anything that might lighten the load. i’m considering teaming up with another solo female traveller to ease the cost of living a bit &amp; have companionship but if that’s not possible, i’d like to know the best way to do this alone. thanks so much!",Shoestring,1613952180

Hello.  I am an American with a US bank as my visa provider.   I hate that when I travel internationally and buy something with my visa, I always have to physically sign something.

SirDank_II,lwzl1a,Bali vs Europe,"Hi all,

Opinions/advice/recommendations/general thoughts on the following would be great thanks

Working in retail sales, my income has been very unpredictable over the course of Covid and being 23, I really feel I should be saving money for house deposits etc. However, I usually travel about 3/4 times per year (1 bigger trip and a couple of European trips), so being trapped at home has been a killer and now the end is in site I'm looking for the next step.

Me and my gf are looking at destinations and realistically feel it comes to two thoughts, either stay close to home because of the uncertainty or fuck it and travel to Bali. I personally love Asia - having visited Japan, South Korea and China but I've never been to S.E.A. My gf has never been to Asia but is looking for a place we can relax and explore on the odd day to see some beautiful scenery and sites.

Sorry if I've waffled but now to the main point. When comparing Europe and Bali, It seems to come out at very similar cost (give or take £100/£200) for a week in Europe or two weeks in Bali. Bali accommodation is just so cheap, I'm looking at places £35-£70 a night for a private villa and pool, it's madness. I'm wondering, is it too good to be true, are these Airbnbs trustworth, are there a lot of costs which would be involved once there than I'm missing? Ik when I read other threads there are recommendations of loads of places to go. Honestly I'm not super bother about seeing everything, just looks nice a nice atmosphere with a few places to explore but mainly sit back and relax. To me, booking Bali in the current climate seems risky, but when it's costing the similar money to going to Portugal, why wouldn't we? 

UK based. Any advice on Bali/Europe in general. Just want a great trip with out spending the world. Thanks in advance.

AudiSales,m6eoyz,ATM conversion rate SCAM at Latin American ATMs you should know about.,"When you are using an ATM in the U.S. or Europe you are probably familiar with the ATM charging you a fee if you are pulling money out a different ATM than your bank. This is normal and some debit cards reimburse you for those fees like the Charles Scwab card.  


HOWEVER, in Latin America, a common bank ATM scam is that you will receive this initial fee message--BUT shortly after you will get receive another message asking you to accept a conversion rate that is sometimes 6 to 10% of the transaction amount on top of the fee you are paying. You can hit the 'NO' button and still get your money. Let your bank decide the conversion rate of money, not their bank or you will get taken to the cleaners every time.   


Here is a video to see this scam in action:

tabletopps,m6f0hg,New York City or Zion National Park?,"My Boyfriend (29M) and I (24F) are planning on taking a trip somewhere right after I graduate in May. Since flights are cheap, vaccinations have started, and the third stimulus package was approved, I figured I would take this opportunity to go somewhere before I start working a full time job. However, we are not sure how covid would affect either places, so we are stuck between these two options. 

This is the planned itinerary for both places: 

New York trip: Statue of Liberty, Metropolitan Art museum, National Museum of Natural History, Buffalo New York, Niagara Falls

Zion National Park trip: Las Vegas sightseeing, Zion hike to Angels Landing, Zion Rafting/tour if possible, Salt Lake City (we are still working out the details on this trip, since New York was our initial plan)

My main concerns are that we would be required to quarantine in Yew York after our flight, and also if Zion would be super crowded due to Covid's effect on other vacation spots. I'm also anxious because I don't know whether I will have another opportunity to travel willy-nilly in the future before I'm old and not in good enough condition to hike Angel's Landing.

C-rad06,m6hke2,How would you spend $1500 CAD on travel if you had 24-h to spend it?,"Hi r/Shoestring.. 

I posted the other day about spending money on something travel related that is easily refundable which was met with some comments about fraud or money laundering. That's not the case. I have been given a bonus from work in the form of $3800 CAD travel credit that I need to spend, expense and be reimbursed for. 

So far, I've got $2300 accounted for with an Airbnb booked over the summer, but now I have another $1500 that I need to spend ASAP (I may be giving notice to this company in the next week or so and I'd like them to pay me out my bonus before I leave). I don't know what to spend it on given I'm usually pretty frugal and we are in the middle of a pandemic. 

So if you had $1500 CAD to spend in the next 24-hours on something travel related, what would you do or book? I'm hoping for something that allows for flexibility but open to options at this point. I'm located in Ontario, Canada if that helps. Unfortunately a golf membership isn't covered so here I am.

Teamsamson,l401zu,Looking for a place where the hotel IS the main attraction?,"Hi there! My BF and I would like to take a covid friendly vacation where we don’t actually have to leave the property much(or at all) to enjoy our stay! 


Time frame: long weekend trip, Thurs-Sun type thing or maybe even Wed night-Sun if it’s a long drive. Most likely spring or summer 



Location: East Coast or within 12 hour driving distance of Hampton Roads VA. More interested in mountains and rural areas as we already live 20 minutes from the beach. But we aren’t completely shutting down beach vacations as long as it’s a completely different vibe from the Virginia Beach scene(thinking something like Key West might be fun)



Lodging: we are open to a hotel, resort, bed and breakfast or Air bnb. If we do an air Bnb, we would love if it was something “different” than just a house, think air stream, tree house, converted barn, etc 



Additional details: we love the idea of a farm that lets you interact with the animals, does interactive tours of the property type thing. My BF loves golf so a golf course on site or nearby would be great. I’m in to yoga and “hippy shit” so a hippy commune type place that does like massages, healing baths(I don’t actually know if this is a thing, just trying to convey a vibe) would be really neat! I’m also obsessed with staying in places that have historical significance—love staying at the Omni-Shore in DC due to the fact that they previously held the presidential inaugural balls there and have had tons of celebrities walk the halls! 


We are aware we probably won’t find a hippy commune with a golf course and interactive farm that has historical significance but anything that has at least one of these things would be great!

Revo0x0c,l7rlm3,Why do you travel?," I get asked this a lot. People find it weird how passionate I am about travel. It started to make me feel weird and that I am thinking the wrong way about life, making the wrong decisions, or missing something about the future that they see but I don't, and it's starting to worry me.

I get asked: ""What do you like about travel this much that you make it your main goal?"", ""Why do you travel now when you can spend that time advancing in your career? When you can maximize your potential in work now?"".

I get told: ""You're still young, focus on work now and you will travel as you want later"".

I see skepticism, disappointment, and judging in their eyes.

So much that I started questioning why I like traveling, and if following this passion without a direct ROI is the right decision. And if I should be ""more grown-up"".

In your opinion, why do we like traveling? What is it in traveling that is so appealing? What psychological needs does it fill? And is it wise to follow this passion and make it a significant goal in our lives over the typical traditional goals of making money, advancing careers, and killing ones-self over extreme workaholism?

FYI I am here to be helped and supported, not to be judged that my thinking is drifting or I am listening to such people. It gets hard when I am alone, the one outlier of everyone around, listening to all of the above all the time. I just need your logical reasoning and reassurance. Your support to make me feel that I am not completely alone or wrong.

\* DEST: ex. Miami/FLL

\* Departure Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20

\* Return Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20. IF One-way just say NA

\* LENGTH: ex. 4 days (If you say 1 week please say 7 days or 7-8 days ect.)

\* Other: ex No Layovers over 4 hours.

\* Expected Budget: \~$120 (optional, Just want to see if I can get below this goal)

\* Bags: Carry-On (Goes in the overhead bin)? Personal Item (fits under the seat in front of you)? Checked Bag? This actually matters in the difference in price alot. EX. 1 carry-on, no checked bags.

Again, PLEASE be as specific and as unambiguous as possible. ie 7/15-&gt;7/30  or +/- 1 day is better than ""Late July"" or ""flexible"".

Honestly when I am at the airport, i go see where my departure gate is, but will have a drink, some food or whatever and end up maybe 20 min before departure at the gate - normally i'd be one of the last people to board and feel i make good use of the waiting time.

Skipping everyone and sit in the plane for an hour longer actually doesn't make sense in my mind. Why would you want to sit even longer than necessary in that plane? Especially when you travel economy anyway?

I also plan my flights so either my stop-over time is minimal or i plan a day-pass and have some local food. As i'll have accomodation, i can freshen up and sleep properly.

I don't really see the advantages to wait in a lounge, other than it might be more private or some gimmicks you don't need. Depending on the lounge i know there is a buffet and free drinks. Looking on how much Lounge access costs, it doesn't seem a great value.

Regarding upgrades i sometimes ask the staff after departure and might just be upgraded for a few dollars or even for free.

I looked up the hotels that offer reduced prices and honestly, they aren't that great, even for the reduced price.

Maybe my way of travelling or my personality simply don't ""need"" all that but maybe i am missing something here.

Zealousideal-Top2651,lcgfcb,DO NOT book with Hopper,"I booked my flight tickets through Hopper.com in January 2020. The flight was one-way from Barcelona to Toronto for August 2020. This flight was chosen mainly because it was a direct fight provided by Westjet (a company I trust). For months before the trip, I was only given a Westjet booking # and a Hopper #. During the Covid-19 months, lot of flights were cancelled and we were allowed to request a full refund in the form of a flight credit/voucher. I requested for that in the summer 2020 but didn't hear anything from Hopper for months and I emailed them again in November 2020 about the status. I didn't get any response. There is no phone number that I can contact them with. I decided to give Westjet a call to see if they can help. I found out that the ticket numbers did not belong to Westjet (as theirs begin with 838); instead they belong to a company called Hahn Air (theirs begin with 169). I started doing some research on Hopper and I found out it is very common for Hopper to issue tickets for itineraries that cannot be ticketed on airline stock. I contacted IATA to complain about Hopper and they refused to provide me with any information or help. I went onto the Hahn Air website and tried to request a refund through their online form, but I didn't have Hopper's IATA code and they didn't recognize the ticket numbers, so that was useless. It was definitely a fraudulent misuse of the E-ticket system and the responsibility is known and shared by both Hopper and Hahn. I started a complaint file with Better Business Bureau and Hopper just simply refused to respond and the file was closed after several months.

KresblainTheMagician,lh36im,Need help with travel methods for a trip to Croatia," My wife and I are planning a trip to Croatia (most likely next year in Aug-Sept) and we are trying to decide on the best method of travel between cities/tourist spots. Our rough plan for travel right now is:  
\- Arrive in Zagreb by plane (stay about 4-6 days)  
\- Take a day trip to Ljubljana, Bled (Slovenia) during our stay in Zagreb to see a few sites  
\- Travel to Plitvice Lakes on our way to the next city (Split)  
\- Stay in Split for about 4-6 days  
\- Take a day trip to Mostar (Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina)  
\- Stay in Dubrovnik for a few days then fly back home from there

I'm not sure if the trip to Mostar would be best from Split or Dubrovnik, and I have found a few tour guided trips to Mostar from each city, so hopefully that makes the border crossing easier. I hear crossing borders to neighboring countries can be quite difficult if renting a car as well as finding parking in cities. The uber rates I saw seemed reasonable for the distances between the cities for our Croatian travel plans, but I dont think taking an Uber to every location in our plans is the best option.

Does anybody here have recommendations for travel between the locations listed? If I can rent cars for just a day at a time just to travel to each location that could work but I'm not sure how much of a hassle that can be. We plan on staying within walking distance of each city we visit so there's no need to have a car for each stay.",Shoestring,1612989375

i have been on the  streets before, but briefly. so while i am street smart for the most  part , i'm not sure about the actual backpacking.

for  gear, i have a wool queen sized blanket that folds up pretty well, and a  70L backpack and a shitty coleman 2 person tent that is years years  old.  I'd get a grayhound ticket but i'm so broke i can't even afford  that and would rather save the money i do have for this trip.

i  am a 30 year old female. i do walk every day about 4 miles, most has  been 12 miles in one day. urban walking though, i know nature walking is  different. as for safety...i'm not that concerned about myself and  comfortable carrying a blunt object for a weapon.

uh....i  guess any tips? any routes to look into? google maps says about 21  days, but that's in unrealistic google time. was thinking leaving mid  january.

Hey! 

I’m a F22 from Europe/EU who has been traveling “full time” since 2016 (not in a vagabond way. More like moving to a new country, get a job and stay there for over a year, and then move on to the next), but I’ve thinking a lot about getting into this non-usual lifestyle which consists in:
- Work a seasonal job for 5 months. Normally from November to March. 
- Live off with that seasonal job’s money for like 7 months. Preferably in Asia or some cheap EU country. 

The thing is, during those 7 months I’d rather volunteer in workaway programs. The experience is amazing if one chooses wisely, plus there is no need to spend much money. 
I’ve done both, volunteering/workaway and winter seasonal job, and they are great experiences. But will I be able to pull both of them together without getting screwed up? Temporarily? Or semi-permanently?

PS: to add some extra information, this will be post Covid and with some savings of 8K/10K. 
This idea came to my mind after volunteering in Poland with covered accommodation + food, and pocket money of €200/monthly from the volunteering organization. I realised that I don’t actually struggle to get by, and even save a little bit.

I'm in decent shape, but not very familiar with long distance cycling..  I have backpacked solo before, so staying alone in hostels or airbnb's along the way shouldn't be a problem. I'd definitely do smaller trips in Norway first, to prepare, and get myself a decent bike.

Alchrops,kwo7x6,Doing a TEFL course,"Hi, my girlfriend and I are planning to go travelling after I finish my degree summer 2022. We want to travel for at least a year but we are also considering travelling long term. If we travel for a shorter amount of time it would likely only be Europe and Asia, but if more long term we would potentially travel to other parts of the world like the Americas. We've been looking for different options for making money whilst travelling and one of the best options seems to be teaching English. This naturally led us to TEFL, which has a sale on some of their courses on now, which will only last a few more days. Now one question is do these sales happen often, or is this a rarer occasion? Secondly, my girlfriend will not have a degree which seems to be a large disadvantage especially in Asia where we will be spending most of our time, so my question is, is it even worth it for her to get it (and should we go for one of the higher hour ones to counteract the lack of a degree)?",Shoestring,1610567178

I'm getting vaccinated (I'm a healthcare worker) and I plan on following guidelines, wearing masks, etc... even if COVID magically disappears. 


But I wanted to know what I can do to pinch pennies on the road. 


For gas I'm getting a rewards card at a station (haven't decided) and I'm planning to stop as much as possible at the same station. I'm still budgeting for gas but I'm using the card for the points and discount. I'll pay the balance as I go along so I don't have any debt. I did the math on the assumption I'll drive 1.5x what the road trip plan says and gas is california prices country wide.


For lodging I'm backcountry camping in national forests and parks (I already looked at the details of every park I'm visiting). In the cities I'll get a cheap hotel in the outskirts of town and take the public transport into the places I want to visit (mostly have no entrance fees as they're national park service locations and I have an annual pass). I still budget as if I was staying at a hotel even on nights where I won't be ($70-90 per night)


For food, I'm buying dehydrated foods I can just add hot water to at the campsite but only buying enough for the camp duration so it doesn't sit in the car and attract bears. Ive scouted supply stores at each of the locations and budgeted food accordingly. I'm budgeting for all three months as though I'm eating takeout every day. 


I'm cutting coffee off already. I don't care about food or sweets and can live off gum as a ""treat"" 


I'm changing the oil myself and have budgeted for oil changes in case I can't 


For supplies, I'm buying them piecemeal. First aid kit, gps tracker, dashboard camera, camping equipment, car maintenance supplies etc... But I've already saved enough for all of them. 


I don't know if this is excessive planning or it's justified being that I'm on a budget but I want tips and advice anyway. I don't get chances like this often (the time off I got was pure luck from a lot of factors converging at the right time) so I want to make it happen.

DirtyBoyzLifestyle,k5c1cw,"36 days in Salinas, Ecuador on ~30 bucks a day.","## Or my alternate clickbait title - living on the beach for 30 bucks a day

For me this is probably the cheapest I have traveled. 

I just wanted to review how much we spent and what we spent it on to see what I can improve on, but at the same time to show everyone that traveling the world is not a costly thing. This is our total budget for [Sam](http://dirtyboyzlifestyle.com/post/slammy) and I's stay in Salinas, Ecuador.

**Tl;DR:**

Groceries: $440.54

Going out/eating out/""activities"": $467.95

Flight: $419 + Transportation: $250.19

Airbnb: $672

Total cost for the trip: $2,269.68

As you can see it was not an expensive month, 36 days technically, with a total cost of just over $1.1k per person.

## Groceries: $440.54

We lived about a ten minute walk from the supermarket. It was called Mi Comisariato. It had six aisles with food, a section for fresh fruit / vegetables / meat / dairy products, and three smaller aisles for household products. While it was not a large selection they had everything we needed. I posted a couple photos so you can get a feel for what the store looked like.

Our typical shopping trip to the grocery store was as follows:

* a packet of ground beef 
* six greek yogurts
* granola
* brocoli
* carrots
* bananas
* apples
* blueberries
* pineapple
* eggs
* water 

We went to the store around three times a week and our cost per trip was usually around $30. Of course our total cost also included things like toilet paper, paper towels, rice, beans, laundry detergent, trash bags, and of course beer for the weekends. As you can see it was pretty easy to maintain a pretty western diet, while we were not able to find everything, it was pretty easy to keep eating what we were used to from home. Since we were there for about four and a half weeks, I would count our cost per week at about $100 or $50 per person which I think is fairly cheap.

## Going out/eating out/""activities"": $467.95

This is the category where we probably could have cut back the most, we had two nights out with bar tab of over $100. Our actual activities were all free as we mostly explored on foot. Overall here the drinks were fairly cheap, $5 mixed drinks, $2-3 beers, and $5-10 meals. If Sam and I were not a little obnoxious at times it would have been pretty easy to enjoy ourselves here on the cheap. I posted a couple photos of the food, but I will go into more detail in my review of Salinas.

## Flight: $419 + Transportation: $250.19

We flew from Chicago to Miami and from Miami to Guayaquil, Ecuador. From there we took a two hour cab ride to Salinas. The price here is for both of our tickets one way. The cost of the rental car we took from Pawnee to Chicago was $107, and the gas to fill up which was $23.19 which is all included in transportation.

On the way there we used Uber since it was available in Guayaquil and cost $70. On the way home we used a yellow cab which cost us $50 since there is no Uber in Salinas. I am certain that that was the ""gringo"" price and you could haggle them down a little. Additionally, there is an option to take the bus from Santa Elena, a couple miles from Salinas, to Guayaquil which only costs $5. Sam was concerned about getting to the airport on time so we decided since were splitting the cost the $20 for the cab were worth it to not have to worry. Especially once you consider that we would have had to pay for the cab to the bus station in Santa Elena and again for a cab or Uber once we arrived in Guayaquil since the bus does not drop off at the airport. Once we factored all of that in, we were fine with paying a small premium to just directly take a cab. While I feel like there was some room here to save some money, it was mostly dependent on how we valued our time by taking the bus.

## Airbnb: $672

I did a full review on the Airbnb already which you can find [here](https://www.dirtyboyzlifestyle.com/post/airbnb-review-salinas-ecuador). Overall, I think the value was good. It was close to the beach, affordable, and close to a grocery store. It was a little lacking when it came to what it offered past that, since it never quiet felt like a home and some essentials were lacking. But for the price the barebones feel could also have been expected.

## Total cost for the trip: $2,269.68

Again the total cost of the trip being about $1.1k for thirty-six is pretty reasonable. In theory you could cover the cost of this trip by working for $10 per hour and still have a little money to save even after paying taxes in the US. I am looking forward to doing the budget for our next stop which is Bogota in Colombia and being able to compare the two. On paper Bogota is supposed to be about 20% cheaper than Ecuador, so I will be curious to see if this will also play out in our total spending.",Shoestring,1606925197

FlippinFlags,jhoc5a,20 months in SE Asia trip report: Singapore Malaysia Thailand Cambodia Laos Vietnam.,"I won't really get into itineraries but feel free to ask if you want specifics or favourites.

Singapore - 3 days.  I think it was enough to see the main sites.  If you eat at Hawker Centers food is $1.50 per small meal.   I did Couchsurfing which is super easy in SE Asia.  But otherwise hostels are $10+.

Malaysia - 2 weeks - Kuala Lumpur - most call it the city with no soul and I agree.  Penang was cool.  Hostels were $5 everywhere I went.  It seems either you love or hate the food in Malaysia.  I personally hated it and that's why I left after only two weeks.

Thailand - 3 months - Bangkok - Chiang Mai - Pai - Mae Hong Son Loop by motorbike - Chiang Rai - Koh Phi Phi - Koh Samui - Koh Tao - Koh Phagnan.  Food is amazing and right up there with Turkish and Mexican (in Mexico).  Hostels are $2-5 in the entire country.

Side Note: Koh Phagnan gets a bad rap saying it's just a party island and I completely disagree.  I went there for the FMP and yes it's crazy that their was 20,000 people on one beach many partying for 2-3 days without sleep.  But as soon as you leave the FMP area the rest of the island is like a ghost town with almost no tourists.. amazing beaches and only a handful of tourists.  It's hard to understand how that's possible but it seems most who've been there agree.  So I recommend going there whether or not you care about the FMP if you're on the fence.

Cambodia - 2 weeks - Siem Reap - Phnom Penh - Kampot - Koh Rong - thought the islands in Thailand were way better.  Hostels are $2-5 in the entire country.

Laos:  2 weeks - Don Det (highly recommended) Vientiane - Pakse Loop by motorbike lots of waterfalls (amazing) - Vang Vieng (highly recommended lots to do in the area.  (place gets a bad rep as a party place but most of those reviews are old - government changed everything - did the tubing and there was nobody drunk or acting rowdy.  Luang Prabang (lots of people like this town I didn't really care for it - too fake tourist town for me)  I know Laos gets skipped by a lot of people - but like most people who've been there ""I love Laos"" and go if you can.  Hostels are $2-5 in the entire country.  Some were $2 with breakfast and a pool.

Vietnam - 3 months - Ha Noi - Cat Ba/Ha Long Bay - Sa Pa - Da Lat - DaNang - Saigon Ho Chi Minh City.  Hostels were the nicest and cleanest in VN.  $1-3 in the entire country.  Cheapest one was $.87 with AC and access to 3 pools, pool table etc etc etc.

I bought a motorbike and rode 3 months from China to Saigon camping in my tent most nights so I won't list all the cities.  I'll add a link to my trip report if interested.

Philippines - Manila - Coron - El Nido - Port Barton - Puerta Princessa - Cebu City - Moalboal - Malapasqcua. Food is terrible (street food) - lots of fat and bone in most meat, or parts of the chicken and pig most tourists won't want to eat) very little vegetables, no flavor, no spice.  I find it noticibly poorer here than the other countries and it's not even close.  Mostly very friendly people.  Budget hostels are generally pretty gross here, old, dirty, lots of things broken, and double the price of the other country.  Most hostels are $5-10 a night.  Internet is always a struggle here too.. the whole island of Palawan was without internet for over a month when I was there.  If it does work it's slow and spotty.   

Food: In every single town and city in all the above countries you can get a local street food meal for $1-1.50.  Every single one. All you have to do is walk 5-10 minutes in any direction away from the tourist area.  Tourist or Western style food (burgers pizza) will be 5-10x the price.

Crossing Borders:  Lots of scamming - fake insurance - face entry and exit fees etc.  Bus drivers making up fake new government laws etc - So do some research ahead of time.  I did a long post here on Reddit if you search in r/laos if you want to read about it - when crossing from Cambodia to Laos where I had a lengthy stand off with border agents trying to scam me out of $3.  I know.. I know.. ""just pay the $3"" ..   I just don't like being scammed or paying bribes..  and if more people make a stand.. these scams will go away.

Scooters and motorbikes:  Yes it can be dangerous and check your insurance before riding but there is absolutely no better way to go around many of the tourist places in these countries.  I learned in Thailand and disagree with most who say it's a bad country to learn in as there's huge shoulders everywhere and the roads are good compared to Laos Cambodia or the Philippines.  So I'd say if you're going to learn it's a great place to do it.  But learning at home is probably best.  Just don't learn in a huge city like Bangkok.  Also get an IDP (International Drivers Permit) before leaving your home country as it'll save you fines and the stress of always looking over your shoulder or the rare huge fine $1000+ and motorbike impoundment.  I paid 4-5 fines for $3-10 in Thailand and Vietnam.  And blew part many other checkpoints where they told me to stop but pretended not to notice.  It's stressful.. get yourself the IDP.  AAA sells them in the USA.  Scooter rental is usually $5 a day.  I've paid as little as $3 and I think $8 was the most.

For those wanting to stay in these countries longer - you can get studios in all the counties except Singapore for around $100-200 in most cities.

I'm still in the Philippines now and I pay $70 per month for a large (for Asia) studio in a nice clean well kept building and they even have $60 per month ones here too.  

Some parting tips.  Agoda.com and Booking.com are way cheaper and have way more options than Hostelworld.com.  

Cheaper 95% of the time, usually 50-100% cheaper.

I and most people I met all agreed once you figured it out.  Hostelworld is mostly a waste of time in SE Asia.

Flights are sometimes cheaper than taking the bus.  I took a bus in Thailand for like 12-13 hours for like $20 and the flight was $10.

A lot of businesses are struggling and / or failing right now, economies around the globe are fairing poorly, and so I figure there must be some way to take advantage of this.

The tourism industry has been hit especially hard. I understand that airlines will most likely just get bailed out, but are there any specific companies or even countries that are offering anything enticing to attract more consumers?

For instance, I'm thinking of:  


1. **National tourism industry deals** (I know Italy was offering an exceptional travel deal for international tourists to make up for their struggling economy - and I heard Japan was maybe going to do the same).  

2. **Hotel discounts.**  

3. **Rental car deals.**  

4. **Airline Tickets.**  

5. **Travel packages or Tourist Attractions.**

Fine.. I'll contact the Airlines about this issue and to no one's surprise, the Airline was confused as well, saying that I would need to contact the travel agency I booked my flight to get my refund. Which makes sense, right?
I called up Travel2be once more and again.. To no one's surprise, they said they have no control over this matter until the Airline releases the order 
-Bull. F*cking. Sh*t.-

It's now September, well over 5 months since this incident and Travel2be still refuses to refund money for the ""Service"" that I never received.
I'm still in the middle of a dispute with my Card company, but the others at Travel2be still think they are entitled to the money they blatantly scammed me of.


TL;DR:  **Stay the hell away from Travel2be,** Do no use them unless you want to be scammed of your money. Ordering through them is like throwing a bundle of cash into the ocean, and even then, that's probably more fun than coming into contact with such toxic scammers.",Shoestring,1600930875
hemlock_hippocrene,izpmqz,American West - two weeks,"My husband and I reside in the U.S. Midwest and are tentatively planning a two-week trip out West next summer, probably June. We're considering:

1. Driving out and flying back. One-way car rentals seems to be VERY expensive, though.

2. Flying out to Arizona or Las Vegas, driving around to some National Parks and monuments, especially Utah. Flying home.

We definitely don't want to drive there and back as we wouldn't have enough time.

Of course we want to sleep as cheap as possible, possibly camp. Should we just try to bring all our camping gear and check it on the flight there and/or back? If a cheap one-way car rental can be found do we just camp in our car?",Shoestring,1601060467

ThisOnlineWorldBlog,j43se1,Saving on Flights &amp; Airbnbs?,"Hey everyone!

I think one of the easiest ways to find cheap flights is to check other airports in your area rather than just sticking with the airport you typically fly out of.

Between doing this and taking red-eye flights, I think it's easy to shave a bit off of flying.

Outside of that, I've mostly been saving on travel costs by booking Airbnbs for at least 2-4 weeks to get discounts whenever possible (obviously this isn't on the table for very short trips).

However, that's about as far as I've taken my savings.

Anyone have something really out of the box to save money on flights or stays? :P

This article on [finding cheap flights](https://dollarsanity.com/how-to-find-cheap-flights/) mentions some cashback websites and apps, but I've never used those for travel, just online shopping.

[This article](https://www.mensjournal.com/travel/best-airbnb-tricks-save-money/reserve-an-airbnb-experience/) also mentions negotiating on Airbnb prices with hosts. Curious if this has worked for anyone!

ArtichokeMother877,j6sp63,"Each camping shelter seems perfect in their own ways. Camper vans are perfect for a bit of comfort and convenience even out in the woods. Tents are perfect for the traditional camping experience, the one that makes you feel all fulfilled inside. So which do you think is better?","Camper vans are becoming highly popular among campers now. It seems such a cozy shelter for camping purposes. It’s now used by people who are just beginners in camping as well as old people who would prefer a bit of comfort even when they’re trying to rough it out with nature. Camper vans also reduce the amount of work we have to do in setting up our tents and makes everything easily available to us. It’s a great way to spend time outdoors without any of the risks of being out in the wilderness. If you own one, you’re already prepared for all future camping trips. And even if you don’t own a camper van, you can rent a good one within the price range of $100 to $200. 

Whereas, Many would say that tent camping is the essence of camping. If you mention camping, the first thing I’d think of is a row of tents all glowing in the night under the stars. Okay, that’s a bit too much but I’m being honest. It does seem like the well-tried and tested shelter for camping out. Tent camping is also the perfect way for you to bond with your family. You can learn about the benefits of some good time out in nature. It’s indeed the perfect way to self-reflect as you sit and hear the flow of a stream nearby or feel the breeze on your cheek.

oh_god_its_raining,ipimiz,Puerto Vallarta on $3-5 usd a day,"Hello fellow shoestring travelers,

I'd like to share my experiences on how to live in a tourist town for next to nothing. A few items to note:

1) During the pandemic, prices are a little lower than normal, so if you're not scared of the virus, right now is actually the best time to travel. Mexico has zero restrictions for U.S. citizen tourists, although they do make you fill out a health questionnaire before you go through customs, you can only fly in (no land border crossings), and security is \*super tight\*. I had to show my health questionnaire to like five hundred people, had my bags searched multiple times, etc. Also it took some doing to get the usual six month tourist visa. Speaking Spanish saved my ass in that regard, as the immigration official had to be talked into giving me the full six months. Basically I told her that I was spending one month on Puerto Vallarta, one month in Merida, one month in Mexico City, etc. I really had to push for it. In the past they just gave you six months without a fuss, but yeah, it's a bit of a different world these days.

2) I always use hostel volunteering/couchsurfing/work exchange/etc for my accommodation. Hostels always have kitchens (with cooking oil and salt provided), and free filtered drinking water, so I never pay for accommodation or hydration. That said, I also live in a hostel dorm room with four other people, so no privacy, A/C, etc. Wifi is usually hit or miss in these places, but it's not hard to find a cheap internet cafe. I'm using one right now, and it's 15 pesos/hour.

3) I don't drink, smoke, or use drugs of any kind. I also don't eat meat or eat out in restaurants/bars. All this helps keep the prices down.

4) I speak Spanish. This does help with eliminating the ""gringo tax,"" but it never goes away completely. 

5) COVID restrictions: Mexico is like the US when it comes to COVID - each state sets their own rules/restrictions. For example in Mexico City, Cancun, and Playa Del Carmen the lockdown is pretty intense. You can't go to the beach/parks and all of the cool spots are closed. But in Puerto Vallarta (in the state of Jalisco), everything is open. People do wear masks but they also don't freak out if you decide not to wear one. My feeling about masks has always been ""do what everyone else is doing,"" so I'll wear one in a store if I see the employees wearing them, and I don't wear one outside, as only half the people here wear masks outside. Inside the hostel no one wears masks. I'm using an internet cafe right now and after I sat down to work I took my mask off. No one seems to care.

So let's talk about Puerto Vallarta, centro neighborhood (far from the resorts) specifically. From now on I'll use pesos cuz I do everything in the local currency when I budget.

Food budget:

Oaxaca cheese (it's the best cheese!) = 40/half kilo. If you don't live on cheese that's enough for a week.

Produce: broccoli, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, peaches, plums, oranges = 200/week

Tortillas = 15/week

Misc guilty pleasure items (yogurt, butter, soda, etc) = 100/week

Other expenses:

Internet = 100/week at the wifi cafe

Toiletries: if you get the super cheap shampoo and sanitary products = 100/week

Typical meal plan:

Breakfast: tortillas or yogurt

Lunch: tortillas with cheese, fruit on the side

Dinner: Steamed broccoli, fried potatoes with onions, chopped raw tomatoes with lime juice

Snacks: small pieces of cheese and fruit

That's roughly 600/week, 700 if you splurge a bit on a bag of chips here and there. Even at 700/week that's $4.50/day USD. 

But then the question comes up, who wants to live like a pauper? Well, no one. That's why choosing the right town is so important. You want a town that offers lots of free entertainment to help offset your frugal lifestyle.

I tried living like this in Playa Del Carmen, for example, with mixed results. The ""gringo tax"" was insane and everything fun required door charges, admission fees, etc. Merida was slightly better but still frustratingly expensive for many things. Mexico city and Guanajuato were both insanely expensive.

Puerto Vallarta has a ton of free entertainment. The beach, obviously, but also the public parks are lovely, full of nice benches, friendly people, and shady spots. The bars have live music seven days a week and most don't have any kind of door charge or drink minimum. If you're staying in a hostel you get to meet people from all over the world who are usually pretty broke as well, so group outings to go swimming in the ocean or just taking a walk around town are a daily occurrence. 

If you're looking for great deals on tourist attractions, sorry but I'm the wrong person to ask. I tend to stay at least 4-6 months in anyplace I visit, and I'm always doing work exchange and/or looking for side jobs the whole time so tourism really isn't my priority. Hopefully these raw numbers, based on current prices, will help you budget for your (possible) future trip to the paradise that is Puerto Vallarta. Happy travels!",Shoestring,1599666996
guernica-shah,ipjk88,travel insurance that covers covid-19,"[safetywing.com](https://safetywing.com) seems like the only provider offering this. at $16 per week it's not badly priced  (i'm 41. worldwide coverage excluding the US. it's $10 if you're under 40), although more than the UK-based providers I'm used to. $250,000 maximum, which should be enough in most countries even if you end up in a coma for weeks (absolutely not enough for the USA though).  the two negatives i see are: (i) unlike many travel policies, there's no short-term US coverage eg. you're visiting the States for a few days en route to somewhere else; (ii) there's only $100,000 for medical evacuation, so in worst case scenarios there won't be a learjet to take your ICU'd self home to die (unlikely, but happened to a friend years ago).

Based on recent discussions, we are currently trialing some auto-moderation features to filter out insubstantial, vague, or repeated questions. As you can imagine, this will involve a bit of trial &amp; error during the initial phase.

**How?**

To make this as smooth as possible, please can you ensure that your posts are;

* Concise, including as much information as possible on where you want to go, what you're interested in doing whilst there, etc. 
* Mentioning a budget (+ timeframe, if applicable)

Please try and be as specific as possible when posting. Questions along the lines of ""What do you recommend in Europe"" are extremely vague, so if you can provide as much information as possible that would really help in r/Shoestring being able to provide a useful response.

In addition, we would ask that you use the Search feature wherever possible. A lot of topics may already have useful threads about them, so please check these before posting.

Failure to adhere to the above may lead to your post being removed without warning whilst we get things sorted.

**Thank You!**

I understand that the current global situation has changed travel significantly, and I'd like to thank you for your ongoing support during these times.

If you have any additional feedback, or if you feel that your post was removed unfairly, then please contact the r/Shoestring moderation team via ModMail, and we'll do our best to resolve the issue.

kezie26,iqacvt,How do you specifically find the best time to buy a plane ticket?,"NOTE: I’m NOT looking to buy a flight now. There’s nothing better to do so I figured I would amuse myself by pricing out what a trip I would like to go on would cost when this all ends and travel is normal again.

For reference, I went to Iceland once and loved it. I want to go back. I know the cheapest time to   travel there is during their off season (basically not summer). When I first went, round trip tickets were $400 or maybe even less. I look it up now, in May, in their off season, and they’re about $800. Is this just because it’s so far out? I thought it was cheaper the farther out you buy? Or is it cheaper the closer it is to your flight when you buy?

Ifch317,ircmhb,Not doing international travel because COVID-19,"Back in March, when COVID-19 shut down everything, I got a cheap flight to Oaxaca Mexico (from the US) for the week of Day of the Dead (end of October). It seemed at the time like maybe the pandemic would come and go, and I would be able to travel by the end of October. 

Well, now it is clear that if I go, it will be in the midst of ongoing pandemic. If I travel, it will be against the advice of health agencies. I will be at increased risk of getting and spreading COVID-19. Because of the risk my travel might pose to others, I have decided not to travel and just eat the cost of the flight. I think Mexico is probably as much a shit show as the US at controlling this illness. If Day of the Dead parades occur in Oaxaca, they will likely be super-spreader events.

So many amazing green spaces, parks etc.

Amazing food.

The most bicycle-friendly city I've ever been - with hundreds of bike kiosks - ride and drop off spots on almost every block in the tourist areas.  my recommendation for getting around.

Cheap Uber is a bonus.

* Clothing Suggestions for both of us  

   * What do you usually wear/pack that is comfy, keeps you warm and maybe even helps keep you from smelling too bad. How many clothing items do you bring?
   * Also, SHOES!! My hike involves a decent amount of switchbacks through water, wondering what your favorite options are.
* Toiletries/Hygiene Items Suggestions
* Trash Suggestions
* Human Waste Suggestions (e.g., trowel vs. bagging it up)

I'm wondering what customers' actual experiences have been when you tried to recover funds invested in travel that is now not possible. Also, if you purchased travel insurance, did it cover your COVID-related cancellations?

My experience:

I had two trips booked pre-COVID, one for a large US city that became the national COVID epicenter while I was supposed to be there, and one for five countries in Europe in the fall. 

I canceled my domestic VRBO a month out, just before the second and final payment was due, and lost about $250. I had also purchased a museum pass for $200, which can be used for up to a year after purchase, and I don't know if I will be able to reschedule that trip in that time frame. I bought travel insurance through VRBO and the airline, and both say that COVID doesn't qualify because I wasn't actively dying. I have American airfare credit for my non-refundable ticket, which will probably expire before I can use it.

For my Europe trip in the fall, I booked US-Europe airfare on United and two Air France flights between EU and non-EU countries. I booked an apartment on VRBO in a country that is currently tightly locked down, and my other hotel reservations can be canceled without penalty. Currently, I could not enter any of my destination countries with a US passport, and I don't blame them. 

One of my Europe flights has now been canceled by Air France about 3 months in advance and I was automatically booked on a new flight. I will probably take advantage of this opportunity to seek a refund for my non-refundable ticket.",Shoestring,1597789934

Could you theoretically camp in the ""closed"" campsites (like the Bicentennial Campsite in the Marin headlands north of San Francisco) and not be bothered by rangers, so long as we didn't start a campfire?

For wilderness/BLM areas like Usal beach and the whole lost coast, do you have to camp in the designated areas or could I pitch a tent right on the beach?

* I'll be socially distancing and wearing a mask, but will people in these cities be too?
* Cafes or co-working spaces open? Need somewhere to work out of for a few hours each day. Don't need fast internet.
* Where are people most social and friendly to strangers?
* Anywhere I should probably avoid as a single British male of Indian heritage?
* Is there a gallery scene right now? I miss looking at pretty and not-so-pretty pictures.
* Which city is best for thrift shopping? (especially for larger sizes.)
* Best for walks? I like strolling city streets for hours on end, observing street life and appreciating a mish mash of architecture and vibrant street art.

So if people want to go on a vacation often they go stay at one destination and then come back.

They take a flight to barcelona stay 3 days then they want to go to switzerland stay for a few days then go to rome for a couple days after that they take a flight home. I think this would be very fun because you'd explore more but I don't know how many people actually would be interested in this kind of thing.

I have also taken your ideas around music and live events which I want to try.

This week we are having a date in Tokyo, while being at home in Barcleona.

Date: 4th of JULY 2020 

We will have to plan it earlier in the day to catch a day/early evening for Japan time.

Dinner (54€): This time around we have more options to choose with variety of sushi sets and my wife being a fan of Japanese cooking. We will take a simple set of sushi rolls and salmon sashimi. Fried salmon with rice 🍚 Some fancy version miso soup🍲 Bottle of Sake Sho Chiki Bai (not many options to choose from)

Tour (8€): we will have a 1 hours tour [Tokyo Local Sacred Tour](https://oqqur.com/events/tokyo-local-tram-tour/), that is live and is 360 degrees, we are promised to learn about the lucky cat and see couple of Buddhist temples.

Experience (13€): As a huge fan of origami art, always wanted to see the traditional way of doing it, so this online experience was a must for me. [Origami and the culture of Japan](https://abnb.me/6B0ixTr1O7)

Atmosphere: I found a nice [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1269581343/playlist/0ig2IiVTh2rnTcTgHZPHPi?si=ZZEoiUQEQbK7p1IyWi56ZQ) with traditional Japanese music

mitchyslick8,hnwxi2,Going on a cross country road trip and would like a more experienced perspective on our tentative plans,"So we’re doing a long term rental with unlimited mileage through sixt. It’s a bigger car, like a Yukon/sequoia size suv. The trip is planned around places we know people so we’ll be couchsurfing/sleeping in the back of the car most of the time except for a few cities where neither will be viable. Looking at fueleconomy.gov it estimates fuel costs to be ~$900 for the trip from Southern California, north up to OR/WA, then East from there kind of zigzagging until we hit South Carolina and then a more direct route through Texas on the way back to CA. The rental seemed to be the cheapest option since neither of us have a car that we could reliably get from coast to coast. I tried the car/RV relocation sites but couldn’t find anything in our time frame or distance. 

Essentially what we’re estimating is:
Fuel:$900
Rental:$1225
Daily food: $20 per day for 25 days $500
Incidentals:$700
So about $2000 per person

Poor_Carol,hrutyf,"Resort closed permanently and we weren't informed, beware of Cheap Caribbean and IGH resorts","This is what I get for booking through a sketchy third party site. My boyfriend is a med student and had a few days off after Step 1 and before his rotations started, so we booked a trip to Mexico back in December. Since he's a med student and I don't make a ton of money, we booked through Cheap Caribbean which he had used before with no problems. 

Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago, we decide traveling to Mexico isn't the most socially responsible thing to do right now, and I attempt to call to cancel our trip. There's a 2+ hour wait time, and the recording advises to wait until within 72 hours of your travel date to cancel. Hoping the flight gets cancelled earning me a refund instead of a travel credit, I hang up and plan to try back later. We're meant to leave for Mexico on July 11. 

On July 9, I call back fully prepared to sit on hold forever. I wait for 2 hours and 20 minutes, tell the representative I'm cancelling the trip because we don't want to travel now, he puts me on hold to look into the resort's cancellation policy. He comes back on the line confused because he can't find the resort's policy, and asks me to wait while he asks his supervisor for help.

He then comes back on the line confused and kind of laughing, and tells me that the resort had permanently closed. Again, we're meant to leave in TWO DAYS and no one had contacted us to tell us. I can't even imagine the headache it would have been to show up in Mexico, not be able to find the transportation we booked to the hotel, attempt to contact them or take a taxi there, and then find out that we had nowhere to stay for the following week. 

Their website says nothing about this closure--I had been monitoring it closely to see what safety precautions they were taking and whether they advised people to keep their travel plans or not. They had a full list of safety precautions and policies, but nowhere do they mention that the resort is PERMANENTLY CLOSED.

At least I got a full refund on the travel I was meaning to cancel anyways, but thank you current events for saving me from being stranded in Mexico for three weeks. 

TL;DR: IGH is not contacting customers or third party agents to say they've closed Holiday Inn Resort Los Cabos, at least I got a full refund for travel I was cancelling due to current events",Shoestring,1594843167

wearethenorth5412,gtq7k3,Farestore/Skybooker - Word of warning. Avoid,"
I’m warning you, AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COST. Just a word of warning this company works under three names Farestore, Skybooker and Destina Travel. Avoid all three!

I booked a flight with this company and due to the coronavirus the flight was cancelled. So I was given two options, a partial refund ($400) of my $840 ticket or $840 of credit to be used towards a different flight.

At first I decided to use the credit but then when I requested a date in November for the same route the company wanted an ADDITIONAL $900 from me for this route. When comparing flights for the same time on different websites I was getting return flights for about $1,000 in total, this company wanted $1,700 from me.

So I decided I would take the refund. I was told I would have my refund within 45 business days... 47 business days went by, no money. So I posted a review of this company online.

I was then called by the company and threaten, “do you want to continue to write reviews online or do you want to get your money back”... what the fuck right??

 So after going back and forward and realizing the $900 they wanted originally was a bit much the company rebooked me on my flight in November for an additional $50.

Once the flights are confirmed I call to pay my $50 as first agreed on the phone, then by email and once more by phone before I pay. Then my card is charged for $70. I later email the company asking what this is about and apparently the extra $20 is a ‘service fee’ to book the flight fare. 

I honestly would avoid this company at all costs. Everytime you contact them by email a new customer service rep takes up your email and gives you a copy and paste answer from his word document. They will make your life a nightmate... I now have a flight booked under them in November and I wouldn’t be surprised if I turned up at the airport and my tickets don’t exist!

I built this particular one on The Ricky Gervais Show featuring Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington - all the transcripts I could find ;)

I built this one to reference only banned books by the likes of Chomsky or dozens of banned books on the occult or current situations....

This one simply draws it's wealth of knowledge from a subsection of reddit posts, and is probably the most likely to beat the Turing test of all of them:

I have a hobby of aviation and finding cheap airfare. I thought rather than just looking at random flights I could do something fun and pay something forward.

Give me your flights in something like this format the more specific the better. Please COPY and EDIT the below format :)

\* Origin: ex. NYC (JFK, EWR, LGA)

\* DEST: ex. Miami/FLL

\* Departure Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20

\* Return Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20. IF One-way just say NA

\* LENGTH: ex. 4 days (If you say 1 week please say 7 days or 7-8 days ect.)

\* Other: ex No Layovers over 4 hours.

\* Expected Budget: \~$120 (optional, Just want to see if I can get below this goal)

\* Bags: Carry-On (Goes in the overhead bin)? Personal Item (fits under the seat in front of you)? Checked Bag? This actually matters in the difference in price alot. EX. 1 carry-on, no checked bags.

Again, PLEASE be as specific and as unambiguous as possible. ie 7/15-&gt;7/30  or +/- 1 day is better than ""Late July"" or ""flexible"".

wiglessmannequin,gztatj,Where to go? (adventure/whimsy/travel),"hiyers!

Me and a good friend have recently reconnected; We want to take a trip soon and we've never travelled together and are super stoked!

We are both in our 30s, single, child-free and want to enjoy this trip by exploring shared interests and having solo adventures.

We don't have a specific place in mind and that's why the assistance is wanted and needed. 

Anywhere that's within 6-8ish hours away from Durham, NC in any direction as we'll be driving.

He plans to work a little bit while on the trip (he's a software developer) but mostly wants to have a good time.

I love adventure, whimsy and travel in general and he enjoys traveling and adventure but driving most of the day in our desired location doesn't appeal to him. I enjoy places that are incredibly walkable or utilizing the public transport options in the area.

At this moment we're thinking 3-4 nights but possibly a week stay.

As far as budget it'd be nice not to spend more than $600 per person.

I LOVE hostels (he hasn't stayed in one but is open to it) we're both open to airbnb and non primitive camping 
We prefer not to have most of the money go to lodging as we'll be out and about enjoying the city/area.

I'm definitely a foodie and will eat most if not all things. He has some minor food allergies so tends to lean towards vegetarianism or explore vegan options. 

We both enjoy food trucks, pizza, ice cream, samosas, mac n chz, tea, coffee shops, mexican food and a la carte.

I love love love being in nature (especially barefoot) I'm not particularly into hiking but enjoy nature walks and find delight in the sights sounds and smells and snapping as many pics as I can.

He LOVES hiking and LOVES waterfalls. He enjoys science museums and we both enjoy art museums. We both LOVE being immersed in other cultures and learning new languages. 

We both love to learn and this trip is an opportunity for us to better understand one another and develop a greater appreciation for our differences.

Sooo in a nutshell:

I was hoping to get some suggestions about places to travel to domestically.

I'll be traveling with a dear friend and our interests don't always align but we have an appreciation for one another and will be lightly planning a trip together for the near future.

We are currently located in Durham, NC and are interested in places that are 6-8 hours away and offer some or all of the ideas, interests and activities below:

hiking. beautiful natural landscape. high walk-ability. tabletop games/board games. thrift stores. yummy low cost local cuisines. liberal vibes. loving kindness. open-mindedness. chill vibes. intellectual paradise. comedy. art. culture. waterfalls. ice cream! . nerd paradise. diversity of thought. little to no racial inequality or tensions. low crime. musicians. local artists and bands. thee arts being celebrated. creativity. pizza. river walks. UNIQUENESS (experiences that are unique to the area). not having to have plans and being able to enjoy each other's company and the company of the locals seeing where the day takes us ((((;

I appreciate any and all suggestions.

We don't want to drive too much and have a preference for cities or states that are within 6-9 hours of Durham, NC (which may very well make it more difficult to find such a place but alas! I turned to my internet community for help)

Thank you in advance !

OGKebabEater,gafvo1,An Island Nation of Redditors with Legalized Drugs," 

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

TravelCenter_UK,ggc2q7,5 Budget Vacation ideas,"Five methods to acquire the most out of your trips:

Think About a Work-Trade Agreement.

Holiday deals might seem worth the cash and ease, but what if you can acquire all those enjoyable, native encounters and complimentary lodging? Work-trade arrangements offer you just that. How it works is easy and precisely as it sounds: You work in places doing anything from milking goats to organic agriculture to easy house sitting and several more in exchange for a roof above your head.

Hire an Apartment or do a Home Swap.

Customarily, holiday-goers have had to reserve a hotel to acquire the facilities of home in a foreign metropolis, but not anymore. Even if you’re dedicated to having a luxury holiday, mainly for a honeymoon, anniversary or big birthday, you could locate luxury lodgings at not-so-high charges. Apartment and house hires (within local guides of your destination at HomeAway.com or VRBO.com), home swaps (HomeExchange.com, LoveHomeSwap.com) and hiring single rooms inside bigger homes (Airbnb) mean that you could receive kitchen stove rights, Wi-Fi access and perfect natural features without paying too much.

Purchase Native Food and Cook.

Given that you’re visiting a place that has reachable grocery shops or farmer’s bazaars, buy native food and think about a charming picnic at one of the adjacent locations or parks. If you have kitchen access, try cooking with never-before-utilized products. In the awareness of saving cash, study in advance what’s native (and therefore, inexpensive) to your city.

Walk All Over.

In the distress of the holiday mindset, throwing unfamiliar amounts of (foreign) cash at cab drivers could frequently be a go-to routine for steering unaccustomed locations. Presuming that you’re traveling in a secure region and are able-bodied, you could come across all types of concealed places and stunning locations while steering on your own two feet.

Redefine Mementos.

Expensive tchotchkes in tourist stores and airports might summon but repel. What are mementos but a gesture to friends and family that you were thinking of them while you were away from home? You do not want a £6 keychain from a Hawaiian gift store to tell them this. It’s usually safe to stay away from purchasing any present at an airport, hotel lobby or any location that bears the term “gift store.”",Shoestring,1589014633

LessthanEli15,glz3hs,Hello! First timer here just toying with the idea of my first time leaving the country solo,"Hi everyone! Once Covid-19 is all gone and more in the past I’d like to finally take the chance to explore Japan by myself for let’s say 3 weeks. 

The only issue is my budget which I’d be looking to keep around 1500-1725. Although I believe I have a few things going for me! I’m more than comfortable backpacking it and staying in the cheapest (while still clean haha) hostels available, I’m an avid walker and biker and love to be on my feet for hours on end exploring everything around me instead of going on the subway or a bus unless it’s necessary, I don’t have much of an interest in going to any sort of fancy sit down places and would rather snack on cheap street food or even whatever I could find at gas stations and grocery stores (I have a pretty weak appetite due to medical reasons which helps in this one case haha) and last of all I’m not into pricy tourist destinations all that much, I really can walk around cities for days and days just looking at the architecture and people or visiting the rural side of the country. 


I am a total beginner to all of this and probably not giving enough details, but I’m more than happy to answer any questions you guys have to help me out!

pacet_luzek,gm9l3v,Pasta recipe,"I'm italian and often during my travels people ask me questions about pasta. Here is my go-to fundamental oil-based structure, hoping it can help you get the most out of your groceries.

Chop onion and/or garlic in small pieces. Put it in a large pan with generous oil (better if olive extra virgin). You can also add olives, dried tomatoes, pepper, chili pepper, laurel leaves and anchovies (or minced cured meat) at this point. As a general rule, black pepper goes with onion; chili pepper with garlic.

Low heat fry and stir until the onion/garlic gets golden. Then add dry herbs, capers, chopped vegetables (including tomatoes, fresh or canned), mushrooms, meat or fish or already soft pulses.

Aubergines, carrots and bell peppers may need different treatment as they take much longer to cook, so they should be cooked a bit already before oil and garlic/onion, unless they are cut thinly.

Cook and stir until almost ready, then keep warm with the lowest heat setting. 

At the same time, get a pot of water boiling, add quite some salt (water must taste just a bit less salty than the average seawater, or like an almost unbearably salty soup) and then add the pasta, possibly of good quality.

When the pasta is still hard, but getting close to ready (roughly after 2/3 of the cooking time written on the package), take it out of the water and unite it into the pan with the sauce. Don't throw away the pasta's cooking water for any reason. Bring back to mid-high heat and stir together mixing pasta and sauce, slowly adding the starchy pasta water with a ladle until the pasta is almost perfectly al dente (firm core but edible).

Add salt and pepper to taste, then let it rest for a minute, lid on. If you want to put cheese or cream (both forbidden if you used anchovies or fish, exceptions may include salmon or shrimps with cream) this is the time. In case of cheese, let it melt for a handful minutes. Also, fresh herbs such as basil and parsley should be abundant and added last. Shred parmesan or pecorino directly on the plates, along with more fresh herbs, freshly squeezed lemon juice and a final splish of olive oil.

Buon appetito.",Shoestring,1589834034
QuinnySnickers,gn2i80,Today I got a $8.75 per night booking in my nearest capital city,"For some reason, a hostel in the city over from me listed the 'Per-person' rate as the 'Per-room' rate on one of their 4 person private rooms... essentially meaning I could book 4 of my mates in for a week away for the price of one person!

TravellingDivorcee,gnesto,Saving money on food when travelling?,"So what’s your travel hacks for saving money on food when on the road?

Eating out is one of the great pleasures of travelling isn’t it? But it also starts to rack up on the old purse strings.

So you can save a fair bit of cash I’ve noticed if you’re a little clever and you make a effort.

For me breakfast is the most overrated meal when it comes to eating out....so I don’t, if I’m travelling in Europe I just take my breakfast cereal measured out into separate bags for the few days I’m away,I buy milk when I land and I’m good to go...breakfast is covered.

For lunch (again this is euro-centric ) I’ll go head to an indoor market where there’s always a few eateries with communal seating or if that’s not available then I’ll head to a Lidl or other cheapo supermarket and make my own sandwich/salad and go sit in a park or plaza and watch the world go buy.
Often in big cities restaurants will have a limited lunchtime special and I’ll treat myself to that but will only drink my own water.

For drinking alcohol I will treat myself and head to a few bars to drink beer... no point in travelling just to sit and count the pennies right? So I usually head to a bar around 5 to hit any happy hours and then depending on the crowd and the mood I’ll either stay out and get a takeaway on the way home or more likely hit the supermarket again to buy simple vegetables and pasta and head back to the hostel with a cheap bottle of vine and I’ll cook up a storm .... there’s always left over condiments like olive oil, salt/ pepper etc and I always gift any leftovers to other travellers.

Another thing I always avoid is buying food at the airport so before leaving I’ll make a sandwich at home or at the hostel and eat that to keep me going
I always have an empty water bottle that I ask staff at the airport restaurants to fill for me.

I realise the above is nothing new but thought I’d share how I save a few $ when travelling.

Anyone got others ways to save on food when on the road?",Shoestring,1589992904

Any advice ?,"Next summer 2021 me and my two best friends (we’re all 21F)  decided we would like to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles California and see if we can figure out how to fend for ourselves on another level . We’ve been out there ourselves plenty of times and always spoke about how fun it would be to experience the life on a deeper scale. We’re all from Arizona and decided on a budget of $15000 for housing accommodations for the three months . We have already spoken about getting part time jobs while out there so food and transportation shouldn’t be to much of an issue . We have also agreed that out of the three of us, two should take our cars. This seems silly to some family members so actual advice on where to stay/ temporary housing options are greatly appreciated! 

If possible we were hoping to stay in a already furnished home (fingers crossed I know this is an expensive option ) we’re not to picky but are hoping for at least a semi decent area . I know this idea is far fetched but this is something we’ve wanted to do for a very long time and now that we all have decent jobs and we’re living comfortably in our own city we would like to expand our horizons ! 

We’re hoping to stay in LA but any other cheaper options are welcome ! Hopefully with this post I gain insight on what exactly we would need to do to prepare and give us an idea on how to go about planning this journey .

Luckily, we have done the research and have prepared a list of the top  25 places to retire in the U.S.A.

#### 1. Huntsville, Alabama

With  13.7% of the population being over 65 years of age, retirees will be in good company. The cost of living is 4.7% below the national average.  Retirees do not pay state property tax and Social Security is exempt from state income tax, making the Yellowhammer state a tax-friendly option for seniors.

Because of this I've already cancelled one flight last month, will likely have to cancel a flight next month, too.  Crossing my fingers I can fly to Europe on trips booked for June and September. 

In the  meantime I've been looking at American Airlines and others that are offering no-fee changes on any flight booked now, even if it says *non-refundable.* 

Right now they are offering round trip transcontinental with carry on flights for as low as $57 starting in June and then $99 from mid-June through October.  Because I'm looking to visit some friends, I'm considering purchasing 2-4 long weekend trips at these prices, given I can change the flights for no cost but here's my question...

I'm assuming I'll have to pay the difference between the fare I purchase and the one I want to reschedule with.  Meaning, If I buy a $99 round trip flight and need to move it, there will be no fee but if the next flight I want to take is $199 I'll have to pay the $100 difference.

Am I missing a hack here? Perhaps the flights are affected by covid and this is reflected in my inability to search flights- but I've had a similar issue when trying to research flights in other ""less traveled"" areas.

sassypritee,g5knqu,Flight help needed!,"Hey you guys! This feels like too much to ask but I don't know where else to go now. I really really want to go home (Nepal) for summer since I've been staying here in Germany for almost a year now and have been really homesick. I don't have much money to spare for a round trip flight (€600 would be the most I can afford for a flight) from Bremen to Kathmandu and back so I wanted to request anyone here who would know details on how to get cheap flights or who could help me out looking for cheap flights to book. 

I can leave Bremen anyday between 30th May 2020 to 13th June 2020 and I would like to return between 29th August 2020 to 31st August 2020. (I can also travel to other airports than Bremen within Germany). 

I also want to point out that all international flights in Nepal is currently blocked and the lockdown is announced to take place till 27th April. However, it could also extend to the end of May or the end of June. If the lockdown is extended till end of June I won't travel.

surlyforshorty,g7wgik,For folks who are having trouble getting refunded due to booking through a third party travel agency--some advice/success story,"I booked two tickets for a trip to SEA that was slated to leave on April 28th through OVAGO. For reference, I booked the tickets at the beginning of January (also for reference, I'm never ever EVER booking through OVAGO or a third party agency ever again). About a month ago , I received an email from the airline that they cancelled one leg of the trip. About a week later, I received an email cancelling the rest of the trip. No sweat, I had a feeling the flight would get cancelled and I was actually waiting for the airline to issue an official cancellation so that I had grounds to get a full refund. However for those who made the unfortunate mistake of booking through OVAGO, y'all know that they are impossible to contact right now. Despite trying to make multiple phone calls, only to be put on held and hung up on after 20-30 minutes due to ""busy phone lines"", I had no success at gaining contact. On top of that, from what I was reading on their facebook page comments (people are pissed lol), I was really nervous that they were going to charge me a processing fee in order to get my refund. Eventually, I used the messaging chat feature on their website which opened up a case for and someone from OVAGO contacted me the next day. Long story short, they told me over the phone that in order to get my refund from the airline, they would need to issue a $100USD for each ticket, which was about 25% of the cost of the ticket itself. I wasn't happy about that, but according to them, I agreed to their terms and conditions when I booked. Anyways, even then my refund wasn't issued, they told me they would need to talk to the airline and afterwards, they would email me to confirm that I wanted the refund in about 3-5 days. Thankfully, they are horrible at actually doing things on time so during that time, I went an alternative route:

&amp;#x200B;

**START HERE IF YOU JUST WANT TO READ SOLUTION:**

Contacted my bank and requested to do a dispute on my debit card. Also for future reference, I'm going to only charge flights on my credit card because it's a lot easier to do the chargebacks on these accounts. Although it turns out that most online transactions are charged as credit on debit cards. My bank mentioned that they don't normally do dispute cases where the transaction is older than 60 days but in the case of travel plans and COVID, they are currently making exceptions. I was able to fill out a dispute form, faxed it over, and waited for a response from them. At this point, I was planning to ignore any correspondences from OVAGO in case they tried to contact me. Of course, they never emailed me about that earlier confirmation for refund and processing fee. About 4 days after I called my bank and sent in a dispute form, I got a notification that the airline refunded the full amount directly to my debit card for both tickets. At this point, I'm super ecstatic and offer this advice for folks who are seeking refund/reimbursement for their cancelled tickets booked through a third party agency: 

DO IT THROUGH YOUR BANK. A FLIGHT CANCELLATION IS THE SAME AS A NON-RECEIPT OF MERCHANDISE. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO THE FULL REFUND, DESPITE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 

Bonus points if your third party agency is as non-responsive as OVAGO.",Shoestring,1587832440

archersonly,fasxyj,Why shoestring travel actually gives you a better experience.,"I think most people see shoestring travel as a necessity, and if we had the money to travel a different way, we would. Personally I don't see it like that, I see shoestring travel as something that enriches my experience whilst travelling. I've made a list of reasons why I think that and I'm interested in what the rest of this subreddit thinks.

**1.  You Gain A Stronger Insight Into Local Life**

Naturally, as a shoestring traveller, you have to go where the locals go. That means eating at local spots, travelling on local buses etc. That means that we will get a greater understanding to what live is really like for residents of that city/ country. More so than someone eating in tourist focused restaurants or travelling by private transport anyway.

**2.  Better Food**

Of course this one depends where in the world you are. But imo, in most places the best food is to be found where the locals are. They're the ones in the know anyway. Tacos in Mexico, thali in India and spicy soups in SEA for example.

**3.  It's More Adventurous**

Surely this is one of the main reasons most of us travel, adventure. Being forced to travel on a shoestring budget puts us in certain situations, that more luxurious travellers wouldn't be in, which forces us to leave our comfort zone and embrace adventure.

**4.  You Can Travel For Longer**

You can either spend $1000 in 2 weeks or 2 months, it's a no brainer!

**5. It's Safer**

Okay, maybe some of you will disagree with this one. However the way I see it, dodgy characters are more likely to target those clearly with a bit of money than some frugal traveller. Thieves targeting tourists go to where the money is, not the cheap places where we will be.

**6.  It's Better For The Environment**

Travelling around extensively by plane is bad for the environment, duh. As shoestring travellers we use less planes and more buses and trains. We also use less private transport like taxis.

**7.  Your Money Goes Straight Into Locals Pocket**

A lot of more luxurious hotels and restaurants are ran by expats and don't benefit the locals very much. When eating in a little eatery or staying in a small guesthouse we can be sure that our money is going straight into the locals pocket.

**8.  You Get To Share The Experience**

Maybe this isn't true for everyone but travelling with another person is cheaper as it allows you to split costs. That means that finding someone else to travel with you is a great idea and travelling with someone else is great. You get to share everything you experience and you have someone to relive the experience with post trip.

I'm very happy to share CocoonWeaver - Voice your self. - with you. A concept I discovered in a dream a few years back and then spent the better part of 2019 developing. Now she's here and offers a simple and unique way to sort voice/text notes / collect things you care about on the go.

If you're interested, feel free to visit [www.cocoonweaver.com](https://www.cocoonweaver.com) or just search for CocoonWeaver on the AppStore. 

Note: it's only on iOS at the moment, but an Android version is in the pipeline. You can pop me a mail to [www.cocoonweaver.com/contact-us](http://www.cocoonweaver.com/contact-us) if you want me to add you to the Android contact list.

Some features you'll see in there:

\- You can use a simple voice command to create or add to a Cocoon (category) and send the note there, transcribed.

\- Location (if you want) you (only) can see where in the world you had your idea. So it has a non google maps- simple map interface where your colourful categories appear on location.

\- Favourite your Cocoons (categories) and position them on your Cocoon homescreen.

\- Send yourself custom reminders to ad a journal entry, say what you're grateful for etc, whatever you want it to say. 

\- Also, it's an app designed fro privacy! The main reason for this us that I believe it wouldn’t be useful in the deeper sense/purpose to the users if the data was mined. Your thoughts are yours and I take that very seriously.

So, yes! I'm very happy to speak with you, should you have any issues or even ideas of how I could improve CocoonWeaver! If you want to support me, please just offer some words as a review on the AppStore. This would be a huge help.

My partner (24M) have saved up about 12-14k and are highly considering dropping our lives in NYC for a while and just get out and see the world. I personally want to do this because I don’t think I’ll be able to save this amount of money again, and also with all the terrible climate change happening in the world, I want to see the earth before it ends in climate disaster haha. 

I’m a little hesitant because I know traveling can be dangerous if you don’t know what to look out for so I’ve been lurking this page for a while for tips and tricks and basically I learned if a local approaches you, ignore them because they want something of mine. 

Basically, my question is where we can go for as long as possible and stretch out our money. I believe we wouldn’t mind staying in hostels but some private time would be nice also. 

And for first time travelers, is this a crazy idea?

My girlfriend and I usually travel to countries during their off-season in order to save money. However, due to our work schedules this year, we won’t be able to travel until July or August. Unfortunately, that’s usually peak tourist season for many countries (which means higher prices). 

So I was hoping you folks could offer suggestions for countries that have off-seasons during the summer. Rudimentary research has shown me countries that are quite far from me and thus too expensive to fly to (I live the East Coast of the U.S.). 

Alternately, I’m open to traveling somewhere during the high season if prices are still low. 

Ultimately, I’d like to keep expenses between $750 and $1,000, if possible.",Shoestring,1583273021

archersonly,fdc8os,How to travel on a shoestring; 10 budget travel tips.,"Last week I made a post on why I think shoestring travel gives you a richer experience, but now it's time to write about *how* I travel on a shoestring budget.

There are many ways I manage to travel on a shoestring budget and I've compiled a list of 10 of my favourite budget travel tips that I use. I'm interested in what you guys think, which you agree with or disagree with and which tips you would add?

**1.  Keep It Local**

The idea is to try and spend as little as the locals in underdeveloped countries and as little as the working class locals in developed countries. That means we need to eat where they eat and travel how they travel. I.e  eating at local restaurants or street food and travelling by local bus, train or boat.  

Of course we're not going to be able to spend as little as them as they're not sleeping in hostels or going to museums, but the more local we go, the better.

**2.  Travel Light**

Something that's often overlooked in the world of shoestring travel. Personally I think it's vital for many reasons. Most obviously not paying hold fees on airlines, but it's a lot more than that. Travelling light also allows you go wherever you want, such as chicken buses in Central America or the subway in modern cities. People travelling with huge backpacks/ suitcases are often forced to get taxis instead.

Travelling light also allows you to take advantage of the best shoestring travel method; walking!

**3. Don't Fly**

This one depends on where you are in the world, as in some places budget airlines are extremely cheap. That being said, in most areas of the world public transport is still the cheapest means of getting around, and in my opinion it's the best way to see the country.

**4.  Research**

Knowledge is power! The more you know about a destination, the easier it will be to stick to budget. Knowing where to eat and how to get around can make all the difference. Also having some idea of the prices will stop you being ripped off by those deceitful types preying on unsuspecting travellers. 

**5.  Avoid Guided Tours and Make Your Own Excursions**

Having a tour guide can be pretty useful however it's not going to help you travel cheap. What I like to do is make my own excursions. Just hire a scooter/bicycle and drive around the sites yourself. Not only is this easy on your budget, it also gives you complete freedom. A little bit of research before your DIY excursion and you're good to go. Just make sure you don't get lost (unless that's your goal). 

**6. Don't Drink Too Much**

I know, this ones harder said then done. However the biggest expenditure for most backpackers is all that drink! I'm definitely guilty of this myself, but if you can limit the drink you're going to save big. 

 **7. Cook Your Own Food**

I'm definitely not saying don't eat at local restaurants but embracing the hostel kitchen is a great way to travel cheap. Shop at the market and cook up a feast (or just cook some basic pasta from the supermarket). The more you cook the more you save, especially if you're in a more expensive country.

Keep in mind though, sometimes street food can be even cheaper than cooking yourself. It's also probably more delicious, no offence!

**8.  Travel in the Off Season**

Cheaper flights and accommodation are the main reasons to travel in the off season. Other benefits include less tourists, shorter lines and more availability.

**9.  Learn From Locals (and Other Backpackers)**

This takes us back to 'keep it local'. There's nobody that knows the place like the locals! Asking them what to do and where to eat etc is a great way to learn how to travel cheap.  You can also learn from other backpackers in hostels, which is a great way to get a conversation going. 

**10.  Travel to Cheaper Countries**

 We're not saying that it's impossible to travel Scandinavia or Japan on a budget. But it's much easier to do so in the Philippines. The easiest, and most obvious, way to travel cheap is to go to a cheap country. Duh! Despite that, I don't recommend skipping countries just because they're expensive, you've just got to be smarter.

-AMARYANA-,fdg4em,How to explore Hawaii for 2-3 months on a budget? Has anyone here done this before?,"Aloha,

I have enough money to buy a van to 'dwell' in while exploring the US and working remotely. However, I've already explored most of the places I want to see in the lower 48. The only areas I would want to spend more time in would be the Western states where there are a ton of great National Parks and cool communities.

Instead of getting a van I could also just buy a one-way to Hawaii and spend as much time as I want on each major island. I've been to Maui and loved it, didn't want to leave. I know there is a good community of 'my kinda people' in Hawaii already, I'd just have to start going to events and making friends.

I have a steady stream of work coming in and also have set up a good foundation to keep scaling my company. I'm not worried about running out of work or money, I have a good system of generating leads and referrals that has gotten better over the last 3 years. Worst case: I have credit cards and a cash reserve for emergencies. 

If you know of any good blogs, articles or accounts of someone living in Hawaii as a nomad, let me know please.

I’m especially interested in any national parks or other pretty nature spots worth stopping at. I’d like to make the Grand Canyon if possible.

Runningoutofideas_81,fedrlv,Digital Nomad lifestyle unlocked...,"I have spent the last 4 months getting my online English teaching job off the ground and I am starting to feel comfortable enough to be more mobile with it. I need to go live somewhere cheap where I can save money on the necessities of life, like food and utilities. I need to pay down some credit card debt.   


Places I am personally interested in, in no order:

Mexico, Southeast Asia, India, Latin/South America, Eastern Europe.

My ideal criteria would be: reliable internet, beaches (learning to surf, SCUBA/snorkelling), hiking/camping opportunities, abundant wildlife, low cost of living (healthier food preferred). Cheap to rent/buy motorcycles. Somewhat safe for dental tourism.

I do have a couple of places in Canada I can stay at basically free, but food is generally expensive. It would be nice to ride my motorcycle to the destination, but I am open to renting/buying once there. I can reliably get cheap airfare to Mexico, but would be relying on Scott's Cheap Flights for anywhere else. 

I don't want to overload myself, so as much as I would love to visit some crazier places, I want a gentle transition into nomad life. So places with less of a language/cultural barrier would be preferred (I speak/read low level French, and VERY little Spanish.)
